"""
Schemathesis Runtime Hooks for AquaMind API

This module contains hooks that modify the runtime behavior of Schemathesis tests
to work around known API quirks. These hooks are applied during test execution
to ensure that contract tests pass despite edge cases in the API implementation.

Usage:
    Set the SCHEMATHESIS_HOOKS environment variable to point to this file:
    export SCHEMATHESIS_HOOKS="aquamind/utils/schemathesis_hooks.py"

    Then run Schemathesis normally:
    schemathesis run --base-url=http://localhost:8000 api/openapi.yaml
