# Audit Trail Compliance Report — October 2025

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Scope**: Completed final audit trail verification for Harvest and Users apps, confirming earlier fixes for Infrastructure, Batch, Inventory, and Broodstock remain intact.
- **Outcome**: All targeted apps now provide 100% coverage for `HistoricalRecords` on tracked models and `HistoryReasonMixin` on mutable API surfaces. Scenario and Environmental apps remain out of scope for this phase per handover direction.
- **Quality Gates**: OpenAPI schema regenerated without warnings; targeted app suites plus full CI configuration test run succeeded.

## 2. Per-App Coverage Snapshot
| App | Models with `HistoricalRecords` | Viewsets with `HistoryReasonMixin` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | 8/8 | 8/8 | Previously remediated; spot-checked with shell helpers. |
| Batch | 8/8 | 7/7 | Verified via existing migrations and mixins. |
| Inventory | 7/7 | 5/5 | No regressions detected. |
| Broodstock | 9/9 | 0/0 (read-only history endpoints) | Coverage unchanged since phase 1 handover. |
| Harvest | 4/4 | 0/0 (read-only) | Confirmed history fields present; API remains read-only so mixin not required. |
| Users | 1/1 | 1/1 | Added `HistoryReasonMixin` to `UserViewSet` and `UserProfileView`. |
| Scenario | — | — | Deferred (phase out of scope). |
| Environmental | — | — | Deferred (phase out of scope). |

## 3. Migrations & Schema
- **Database migrations**: None generated; existing historical tables already present for Harvest and Users models.
- **OpenAPI schema**: `python manage.py spectacular --file api/openapi.yaml --validate --fail-on-warn`
  - Result: schema updated to reflect Users audit mixin descriptions; operation ID fix hook executed successfully; zero warnings.

## 4. Verification Tests
- `python manage.py test apps.harvest --settings=aquamind.settings_ci`
- `python manage.py test apps.users --settings=aquamind.settings_ci`
- `python manage.py test --settings=aquamind.settings_ci`
  - Result: 1,046 tests, 0 failures, 62 skips (expected Timescale-dependent cases).

## 5. Compliance Status
- **Regulatory coverage**: All production-facing CRUD endpoints for targeted apps now record change reasons via `HistoryReasonMixin`.
- **Historical data capture**: Every tracked model incorporates `HistoricalRecords`, confirming end-to-end audit traceability across Infrastructure, Batch, Inventory, Broodstock, Harvest, and Users.
- **Outstanding follow-ups**: Scenario and Environmental apps to be revisited only if regulatory scope expands; no open blockers.

## 6. Recommendations
1. Maintain schema regeneration (Spectacular) after any audit-related code changes.
2. Re-run the full `settings_ci` suite before PR merges touching audit infrastructure.
3. Schedule periodic spot-check of Timescale-enabled environments to ensure historical tables sync after deploys.
