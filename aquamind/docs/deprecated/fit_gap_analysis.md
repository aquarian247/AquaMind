# AquaMind Fit/Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

AquaMind’s backend implements the vast majority of Phase 1 (Core Operations) and a meaningful subset of Phase 2 (Scenario Planning and API standardization). Broodstock management and Scenario Planning are robust. Inventory, Health, Environmental, Infrastructure, Users, and Batch management are in place with consistent, contract-first APIs. Operational dashboards/planning remain minimal, and formal compliance reporting plus Phase 3 AI/Genomics are not yet implemented. The API layer has been standardized and synchronized with the frontend via a single OpenAPI source of truth and contract testing.

* Phase 1 (MVP): Largely implemented across domains: Infrastructure, Batch, Inventory, Health, Environmental, Users, Broodstock; dashboards exist partially via endpoints (operational app minimal) [1][3][5][7–16].  
* Phase 2 (in scope/next): Scenario Planning is feature-rich (models, projections, CSV uploads, comparisons). Operational planning and regulatory reporting are partial/not started [1][3][14][16].  
* Phase 3 (future): Predictive Health and Genomic Prediction are not implemented [1].  
* Technical posture: Contract-first API with drf-spectacular, Schemathesis hooks, and automated frontend client generation; explicit kebab-case basenames and clean path-includes unify the API surface [3][4][7][8].

## Scope and Method

* Sources: PRD, Architecture, Data Model, API standards, central router and app routers, auth URLs [1–18].  
* What “Implemented” means: Discoverable endpoints + viewsets consistent with the PRD; not an exhaustive UX validation.  
* What’s out of scope: Frontend/UI completeness, external integrations standing up (e.g., Wonderware/OWM connectors), production infra.  

## Fit/Gap Matrix (by Domain)

| Domain | Status | Implemented Highlights | Key Gaps / Next Work |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure | Implemented | CRUD for geographies, areas, stations, halls, container types/containers, sensors, feed containers; aggregated overview endpoint [9] | Alerting rules and UI are PRD-level items; ops dashboards handled under Operational Planning [1] |
| Batch | Implemented | Species, lifecycle stages, batches, container assignments, compositions, transfers, mortalities, growth samples [10] | K-factor calc/storage assumed per PRD; verify model-level computations and audit trail coverage [1] |
| Inventory (Feed) | Implemented | Feeds, purchases, feed stock, FIFO container stock, feeding events, batch feeding summaries [11] | Verify automatic FIFO-cost attribution on FeedingEvent and low-stock alert flows [1] |
| Health | Implemented | Journal entries, sample types, health sampling events, individual fish obs, fish parameter scores, mortality records, lice counts, treatments/vaccinations [12] | Validate aggregate metric calculations in events; file upload limits; reporting views [1] |
| Environmental | Implemented (data model + APIs) | Parameters, readings (Timescale), photoperiod, weather, stage transitions [13] | External ingestion connectors to Wonderware/OWM; anomaly alerts; continuous aggregates [1][3] |
| Users/Auth | Implemented | JWT auth + profile endpoints for production; dev token endpoints for CI/local; user CRUD [5][6][17][18] | N/A (AD/LDAP optional later per arch) [3] |
| Scenario Planning | Implemented (rich) | TGC/FCR/Mortality models, temperature profiles, biological constraints, scenario creation/duplication, CSV upload & date-range input, projections, sensitivity analysis, exports and comparisons [14] | Extend model libraries/templates; link projections to ops planning [1] |
| Broodstock | Implemented | Maintenance tasks, broodstock fish, movements, breeding plans & trait priorities, pairs, egg production (internal), external egg batches, batch parentage [15] | Phase 2 “enhanced” genetics integrations/recommendations [1] |
| Operational Planning/Dashboards | Partial | FCR trends endpoint exists [16] | Recommendation engine, planning dashboards, resource scheduling, acceptance/rejection logs [1] |
| Regulatory Compliance/Reporting | Not started | — | Report generators for environmental/health/financial compliance, templates/exports, alerts; audit report surfaces [1] |
| Phase 3 AI (Predictive Health, Genomics) | Not started | — | ML pipelines, model serving, integrations, explainability, monitoring [1] |

Notes:  
* API standardization is complete: single clean include-per-app pattern and explicit kebab-case basenames across routers [7–8][9–16].  
* Contract-first sync to frontend with OpenAPI 3.1, and Schemathesis hooks is documented and referenced in settings and architecture [3][5][6].  

## Detailed Findings

### 1) API Architecture and Standards
* Main router uses explicit path includes for each app; prior `registry.extend` duplication eliminated, avoiding 404 noise and spec drift [7][4].  
* Kebab-case explicit basenames across all app routers (batch, env, health, inventory, infrastructure, scenario, broodstock, operational) [8–16].  
* drf-spectacular configured as single source of truth, schema endpoints exposed, Swagger/ReDoc available; JWT as primary auth; token auth for dev/CI flows [5][6].  
* Contract-first process with artefact upload, frontend codegen, and Schemathesis contract testing as gates [3].

### 2) Core Domains (Phase 1)
* Infrastructure: CRUD and an overview aggregation endpoint implemented [9].  
* Batch: Endpoints cover lifecycle, assignments, transfers, mortality, growth sampling [10].  
* Inventory: Feed types, purchases, FIFO container stock, feeding events, batch feeding summaries implemented [11].  
* Health: General journaling + detailed sampling and lab frameworks present [12].  
* Environmental: Parameters/readings/photoperiod/weather/stage transitions present; Timescale usage per architecture/settings [13][3][5].  
* Users/Auth: JWT flow plus dev token helper; user profile/me and user CRUD via users URLs [5][6][17][18].

### 3) Advanced Domains (Phase 2)
* Scenario Planning: Full model management, multi-method data entry (CSV + date ranges), projections, sensitivity analysis, comparisons, exports [14].  
* Broodstock: Full CRUD with internal/external eggs and lineage to batches via parentage; bulk transfers and dashboards building blocks present [15].  
* Operational Planning: Minimal (FCR trends). PRD requires recommendation engine and planning dashboards [16][1].  
* Compliance Reporting: No dedicated reporting endpoints or templates observed [1].

### 4) Phase 3 (Future AI)
* Predictive Health and Genomic Prediction: Not present; consistent with PRD roadmap [1].

## Recommendations and Roadmap

### Near-term priorities (highest value / lowest risk)

1. **Operational Planning foundations (Phase 2)**  
   • Implement recommendation engine services and endpoints: batch transfers, feed optimization, capacity/utilization alerts [1].  
   • Add planning dashboard APIs (summaries, bottlenecks, acceptance logs); wire into operational app [16].  
   • Dependencies: batch assignments/biomass summaries [10][11], environmental thresholds [13].

2. **Regulatory compliance and reporting**  
   • Introduce report generators (environmental/health/financial), export endpoints (CSV/PDF), and scheduled jobs; surface audit trails in reports [1][5].  
   • Add threshold/violation alerts and history endpoints; align with Timescale continuous aggregates for performance [3][5].

3. **Environmental integrations & aggregates**  
   • Implement Wonderware and OpenWeatherMap ingestion jobs; define durable connectors and error handling [1][3].  
   • Add continuous aggregates/materialized views for common KPIs; expose summaries via API [3].

4. **Scenario ↔ Operations bridge**  
   • Publish projection summaries (harvest timeline, biomass, daily feed) as operational inputs; cross-link batches/scenarios [14].

5. **Broodstock Phase 2**  
   • Genetics data model and import pipelines; pair recommendation endpoints; lineage analytics [1][15].

6. **Quality and governance**  
   • Verify K-factor and FIFO cost auto-calculation paths; add contract tests where missing [1][10][11].  
   • Keep API standards enforced via CI (no `registry.extend`, kebab-case basenames) [8].

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| External data dependencies (Wonderware/OWM) | Data gaps, ingestion failures | Retries, DLQs, observability, graceful degradation [3] |
| Reporting performance | Slow compliance exports | Timescale continuous aggregates, caching [5] |
| Contract stability | Frontend/backend drift | Maintain OpenAPI generation and Schemathesis gates, enforce API standards [3][5][8] |

## Quick Wins

* Add operational summary endpoints (utilization, upcoming capacity issues) to operational app [16].  
* Provide violation/threshold endpoints for environmental anomalies [13].  
* Expose inventory low-stock alerts and FIFO-cost audit views [11].  

## Conclusion

Core MVP is strong and consistent with the PRD. The platform is technically sound (contract-first, standardized API) and ready to expand into Operational Planning, Compliance Reporting, and eventual AI features. Prioritizing operational planning endpoints, compliance reports, and environmental integrations will deliver the most immediate value.
