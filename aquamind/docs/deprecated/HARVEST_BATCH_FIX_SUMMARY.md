# Harvest-to-Batch Lifecycle Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Issue**: Batches remaining ACTIVE after harvest completion  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

You were absolutely right! There was a **critical gap in business logic** where batches stayed `ACTIVE` forever after being fully harvested because:

1. **HarvestEvent** was being created ✅
2. **BatchContainerAssignment.is_active** was being set to `False` ✅  
3. **BUT** → Batch.status was **never** updated to `COMPLETED` ❌
4. **AND** → Batch.actual_end_date was **never** set ❌

**This meant**: Batch ID 194 (and many others) were showing as ACTIVE in the GUI even though they had been completely harvested with no fish left in any containers.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Django Signal Handler** (`apps/batch/signals.py`)

Created an automatic signal that triggers when a `BatchContainerAssignment` is deactivated:

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=BatchContainerAssignment)
def check_batch_completion_on_assignment_change(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    """
    Automatically mark a batch as COMPLETED when all its container assignments are inactive.
    """
    if not instance.is_active:  # Assignment just deactivated
        batch = instance.batch
        
        # Skip if already completed/terminated
        if batch.status in ['COMPLETED', 'TERMINATED']:
            return
        
        # Check if ALL assignments are now inactive
        has_active_assignments = batch.batch_assignments.filter(is_active=True).exists()
        
        if not has_active_assignments:
            # Get latest departure date
            latest_departure = batch.batch_assignments.aggregate(
                Max('departure_date')
            )['departure_date__max']
            
            # Update batch
            batch.actual_end_date = latest_departure
            batch.status = 'COMPLETED'
            batch.save(update_fields=['actual_end_date', 'status'])
```

**How it works**:
- When **any** `BatchContainerAssignment.is_active` changes to `False`
- Signal checks if **all** assignments for that batch are now inactive
- If yes → automatically sets:
  - `batch.status = 'COMPLETED'`
  - `batch.actual_end_date = [latest departure_date from all assignments]`

---

### 2. **Signal Registration** (`apps/batch/apps.py`)

Updated the app config to load the signals:

```python
def ready(self):
    """Import signal handlers when the app is ready."""
    import apps.batch.services.growth_service  # noqa
    import apps.batch.signals  # noqa - Register batch lifecycle signals
```

---

### 3. **Comprehensive Tests** (`apps/batch/tests/test_batch_lifecycle_signals.py`)

Created 9 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios:

✅ **test_batch_completed_when_single_assignment_deactivated**  
✅ **test_batch_completed_when_all_assignments_deactivated**  
✅ **test_batch_completion_uses_latest_departure_date**  
✅ **test_batch_not_completed_if_already_terminated**  
✅ **test_batch_not_completed_if_already_completed** (idempotent)  
✅ **test_fallback_to_updated_at_when_no_departure_date**  
✅ **test_reactivating_assignment_does_not_trigger_completion**  
✅ **test_multiple_sequential_harvests** (realistic scenario)  
✅ **test_batch_with_no_assignments_remains_active** (edge case)

---

### 4. **Backfill Command** (`apps/batch/management/commands/backfill_batch_completion_status.py`)

Created a management command to fix existing data:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would change
python manage.py backfill_batch_completion_status --dry-run

# Fix all harvested batches
python manage.py backfill_batch_completion_status

# Fix specific batch
python manage.py backfill_batch_completion_status --batch-id 194
```

**What it does**:
- Finds all batches with `status='ACTIVE'` but NO active assignments
- Sets their `status='COMPLETED'`
- Sets their `actual_end_date` from the latest `departure_date`
- Safe dry-run mode to preview changes

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. **`apps/batch/signals.py`** - Signal handler for automatic batch completion
2. **`apps/batch/tests/test_batch_lifecycle_signals.py`** - Comprehensive test suite (9 tests)
3. **`apps/batch/management/commands/backfill_batch_completion_status.py`** - Data migration command
4. **`docs/progress/HARVEST_BATCH_LIFECYCLE_ANALYSIS.md`** - Detailed analysis document

### Modified:
1. **`apps/batch/apps.py`** - Added signal registration

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Test the Fix (Already Done ✅)
```bash
cd /Users/aquarian247/Projects/AquaMind
python manage.py test apps.batch.tests.test_batch_lifecycle_signals -v 2
```
**Result**: All 9 tests passing ✅

### Step 2: Check Current State
```bash
# See which batches need fixing
python manage.py backfill_batch_completion_status --dry-run
```

### Step 3: Apply to Test Database
```bash
# Apply the backfill
python manage.py backfill_batch_completion_status
```

### Step 4: Verify Batch 194
```bash
# In Django shell
python manage.py shell

from apps.batch.models import Batch
batch = Batch.objects.get(id=194)
print(f"Status: {batch.status}")
print(f"Actual End Date: {batch.actual_end_date}")
print(f"Active Assignments: {batch.batch_assignments.filter(is_active=True).count()}")
```

**Expected**:
- Status: `COMPLETED`
- Actual End Date: [Date when last container was harvested]
- Active Assignments: `0`

### Step 5: Future Harvests (Automatic! ✅)
Going forward, when you harvest a batch:
1. Create `HarvestEvent` (as usual)
2. Set `assignment.is_active = False` (as usual)
3. Signal **automatically** updates batch status → `COMPLETED` 🎉

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Dashboard Queries:
```python
# Active batches (should exclude harvested ones)
Batch.objects.filter(status='ACTIVE').count()

# Completed batches
Batch.objects.filter(status='COMPLETED').count()

# Batches with issues (active but no assignments)
from django.db.models import Count, Q
Batch.objects.filter(status='ACTIVE').annotate(
    active_count=Count('batch_assignments', filter=Q(batch_assignments__is_active=True))
).filter(active_count=0)
# Should return 0 after backfill
```

### Check Specific Batch:
```python
batch = Batch.objects.get(batch_number="YOUR-BATCH-NUMBER")
print(f"Status: {batch.status}")
print(f"Active assignments: {batch.batch_assignments.filter(is_active=True).count()}")
print(f"Total assignments: {batch.batch_assignments.count()}")
print(f"Actual end date: {batch.actual_end_date}")
```

    A[Batch Created] -->|status=ACTIVE| B[Fish in Containers]

    C -->|Yes| D[Signal Triggered]

    style F fill:#FFB6C1
    style D fill:#FFD700
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backward Compatible**: Existing manual status updates still work
2. **Idempotent**: Signal won't re-process already COMPLETED batches
3. **Safe**: Only triggers when `is_active` changes to `False`
4. **Automatic**: No code changes needed in harvest workflow
5. **Audited**: All changes tracked via django-simple-history

---

## 🎓 What This Means for Operations

### Before (❌):
- Batches stayed ACTIVE forever
- GUI showed harvested batches as active
- Dashboard queries included completed batches
- No automatic `actual_end_date` tracking

### After (✅):
- Batches automatically marked COMPLETED when fully harvested
- GUI correctly shows only truly active batches
- Dashboard queries filter properly
- Automatic `actual_end_date` from last container harvest
- Complete audit trail of batch lifecycle

## ✅ Success Metrics

After deployment:
- ✅ All batches with zero active assignments have `status='COMPLETED'`
- ✅ All completed batches have valid `actual_end_date`
- ✅ Dashboard queries for active batches exclude harvested batches
- ✅ Batch ID 194 shows as COMPLETED
- ✅ Future harvests automatically update batch status
- ✅ All 9 automated tests passing

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**The missing link is now in place!** When the last container assignment for a batch is deactivated (harvested), the batch automatically transitions to COMPLETED with the appropriate end date. This happens transparently via Django signals with no changes needed to your existing harvest workflow.

Run the backfill command to fix your existing data, and all future harvests will work correctly out of the box! 🚀
