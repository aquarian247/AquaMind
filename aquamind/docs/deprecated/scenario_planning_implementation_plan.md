# Scenario Planning App Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation strategy for the AquaMind Scenario Planning and Simulation module. The implementation follows Django best practices and integrates with existing AquaMind infrastructure to provide comprehensive aquaculture scenario modeling capabilities.

**Note on UI Development**: This implementation plan focuses on Django admin interface for testing and fallback purposes. The Django admin provides a functional interface for all scenario planning features but with limitations on advanced visualizations. A separate frontend implementation (Vue.js or similar) will be developed later for end-user interactions with rich visualizations and interactive charts.

## Scenario Planning Purpose
The Scenario Planning and Simulation feature enables aquaculture managers to create, manage, and analyze hypothetical scenarios for salmon farming operations. By leveraging configurable biological models (TGC, FCR, and mortality models), this feature projects key metrics such as fish growth, population, biomass, feed consumption, and optimal harvest times for data-driven decision-making.

## History Tracking Decision
Based on the implementation of django-simple-history for critical models, the following scenario models should include history tracking for regulatory compliance and operational transparency:
- **Scenario** - Track scenario modifications and parameter changes
- **ScenarioModelChange** - Critical for tracking model switches during scenarios
- **TGCModel** - Track model parameter changes for reproducibility
- **FCRModel** - Track feed efficiency model modifications
- **MortalityModel** - Track mortality rate changes

## Technical Decisions

### Model Architecture
- **Temperature Profiles**: Normalized structure with TemperatureProfile and TemperatureReading for flexibility
- **Stage-Based FCR**: FCRModelStage links to batch_lifecyclestage for consistency with existing lifecycle management
- **Projection Storage**: ScenarioProjection uses TimescaleDB considerations for efficient time-series queries
- **Model Versioning**: History tracking enables model evolution and projection reproducibility

### Calculation Engine Design
- **Daily Precision**: All calculations performed at daily resolution for maximum accuracy
- **Modular Services**: Separate services for TGC, FCR, and mortality allow independent testing and modification
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive input validation prevents unrealistic scenarios
- **Performance Optimization**: Calculation caching and batch processing for large datasets

### Integration Strategy
- **Batch Linkage**: Optional batch_id in Scenario model enables real-data initialization
- **Environmental Sync**: Integration with environmental app for temperature data when available
- **Lifecycle Consistency**: Reuse of batch_lifecyclestage ensures compatibility with existing workflows

### Data Entry Architecture
- **Multi-Method Support**: Flexible backend APIs supporting CSV upload, date ranges, templates, visual editing, and formula-based input
- **Template System**: Normalized template storage with versioning, sharing, and inheritance capabilities
- **Bulk Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets (900+ values) with background processing and progress tracking
- **Real-Time Validation**: Client-server validation framework ensuring data integrity across all input methods
- **Preview Generation**: On-demand chart and summary generation for immediate user feedback

## Regional Considerations

### Faroe Islands Specifications
- **Stable Temperature Profiles**: Gulf Stream influence creates predictable temperature patterns
- **Simplified TGC Models**: Less temperature variation allows for more stable growth projections
- **Standard Lifecycle Timing**: Consistent environmental conditions enable standardized stage durations

### Scotland Specifications
- **Variable Temperature Profiles**: Diverse locations require site-specific temperature models
- **Release Timing Variations**: Summer vs. winter release patterns need distinct TGC models
- **Location-Specific Models**: Multiple TGC models per region for accurate projections

## User Story Implementation

- **Scenario Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis with difference highlighting

### Projection Analysis
- **Growth Tracking**: Interactive charts showing weight progression to harvest targets
- **Feed Planning**: Consumption forecasts for inventory management
- **Harvest Optimization**: Timing recommendations based on target weights and biomass limits

## Data Requirements

### Model Data
- **TGC Models**: Location, release period, temperature profiles, growth coefficients
