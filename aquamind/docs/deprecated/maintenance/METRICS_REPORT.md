## AquaMind Backend - Daily Metrics Report

Date: 2025-09-14 (UTC)

### Executive Summary
- Overall codebase is maintainable with most files ranked A by Maintainability Index (MI).
- Hotspots detected in `scenario`, `batch`, and `inventory` apps by LOC and complexity.
- Highest cyclomatic complexity occurs in serializer validations and analytical services.
- Environmental app has a `U+FEFF` BOM in `api/viewsets.py` flagged by tools; remove BOM to restore analyzer compatibility.
- Cognitive complexity flags concentrate in `scenario/api/serializers.py`, `inventory/services/fcr_service.py`, and projection/calculation engines.

### Key Metrics
- Top apps by Lines of Code (excluding `operational`):
  - scenario: 5726
  - batch: 4621
  - inventory: 4273
  - health: 4175
  - infrastructure: 3451
- Worst Maintainability Index (lowest MI):
  - scenario/api/serializers.py → 12.76
  - batch/api/viewsets.py → 35.95
  - inventory/services/fcr_service.py → 38.36
  - infrastructure/management/commands/validate_openapi.py → 38.83
  - environmental/admin.py → 39.35
- Highest Cyclomatic Complexity (CC ≥ 15):
  - batch/api/serializers/growth.py:_process_individual_measurements → 24
  - batch/api/viewsets.py:compare → 22
  - batch/api/serializers/composition.py:BatchCompositionSerializer.validate → 20–21
  - inventory/services/fcr_service.py:aggregate_container_fcr_to_batch → 21
  - infrastructure/management/commands/validate_response_codes → 18
  - scenario/services/calculations/projection_engine.py:run_projection/run_sensitivity_analysis → 15–17
- Cognitive Complexity (by occurrence count):
  - scenario/api/serializers.py (40)
  - inventory/services/fcr_service.py (20)
  - scenario/api/viewsets.py (12)
  - health/api/utils.py (10), health/api/serializers/health_observation.py (10)

### Notable Findings
- Environmental module analyzer errors: BOM in `apps/environmental/api/viewsets.py` prevents parsing by radon in some modes.
- Several long files and multi-responsibility viewsets/serializers indicate refactor opportunities.

### Recommendations (Actionable)
1) Reduce complexity in serializer validations
   - Extract per-field and cross-field checks into helper functions.
   - Target: `batch/api/serializers/growth.py`, `composition.py`, `transfer.py`.
2) Decompose large viewsets
   - Split `batch/api/viewsets.py` by resource (or use mixins/DRY helpers).
   - Move filter logic into dedicated filter classes/helpers.
3) Optimize analytical services
   - `inventory/services/fcr_service.py`: Split aggregation and IO; apply early returns.
   - Add typing and guard clauses to simplify branches.
4) Fix Environmental BOM
   - Remove U+FEFF from `apps/environmental/api/viewsets.py` to restore tooling compatibility.
5) Track progress via CI metric gates
   - Add thresholds for CCN (<15) and MI (>50) on changed files.
