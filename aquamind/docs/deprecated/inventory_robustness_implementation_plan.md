# Inventory Robustness Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This implementation plan addresses the critical gaps in the inventory app's ability to handle real-world data challenges, as outlined in the "Feed Management and Data Quality" requirements document. The plan focuses on building robust systems for data correction, quality monitoring, and reconciliation while maintaining the existing functionality and following established AquaMind quality standards.

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Quality Framework (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus**: Foundation for handling imperfect data and corrections

### Phase 2: Data Correction & Override System (Weeks 2-3)  
**Focus**: Structured workflows for data corrections and manual overrides

### Phase 3: Reconciliation & Quality Monitoring (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Generic reconciliation framework and automated quality checks
