# Personas and Profiles in AquaMind V2

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: December 18, 2025  
**Context**: AI-Native Evolution (Target: H2 2026 – H1 2027)

The transition to AquaMind V2 represents a fundamental shift from a traditional data-entry and dashboard-driven system to an **AI-native platform**. The core interface becomes a proactive, conversational agent that continuously monitors the full operational dataset, reasons across domains, and handles routine tasks autonomously—surfacing only what requires human expertise, judgment, or collaboration.

Personas evolve accordingly: administrative burdens (manual logging, form-filling, report compilation) largely disappear. Users interact primarily through natural language (voice/text), proactive notifications, and ephemeral visualizations. The AI acts as an intelligent partner—drafting plans, flagging risks, executing approved actions, and learning from overrides—while preserving full auditability and regulatory compliance.

This document reimagines the original personas in this new context, focusing on oversight, decision-making, and collaboration with the AI. New behaviors emphasize trust calibration, rapid review/approval, and strategic input.

## Core Principles Guiding V2 Personas

- **Minimal Intervention**: Routine data capture (mortality counts, environmental logs, journal notes) is voice/photo-assisted or fully automated via sensors/AI parsing.
- **Proactive Surfacing**: The AI pushes role-specific "attention lists" (anomalies, opportunities, pending judgments) rather than requiring users to pull data.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical decisions (culling, treatment approval, period locking, strategic overrides) require explicit human confirmation.
- **Natural Interaction**: Voice-first for field users; conversational chat with dynamic renders (charts, camera overlays, simulations) for managers.
- **Learning Loop**: User corrections refine future AI suggestions, building personalized trust over time.

## Veterinarians

**Background**: Passionate animal health experts responsible for fish welfare across the lifecycle.

**Goals**:
- Prevent and respond to health threats rapidly.
- Advance disease resistance through data-driven insights.
- Meet regulatory reporting with minimal effort.

**Motivations**:
- Deep care for animal welfare and sustainability.
- Satisfaction from proactive prevention rather than reactive crises.
- Desire to focus on diagnosis and research, not administration.

**Pain Points (Mitigated in V2)**:
- Historical Excel journaling burden eliminated—AI drafts entries from voice notes, uploaded images, or sensor trends.
- Fragmented data access resolved—AI provides instant cross-batch health context.

**Challenges**:
- Calibrating trust in AI diagnostic suggestions.
- Overriding AI in nuanced cases (e.g., emerging pathogens).

**Behavior Patterns**:
- Start day with AI health brief: "Top 3 risk batches today."
- Upload photos/videos → AI proposes diagnosis + treatment draft.
- Voice-approve or refine journal entries/treatments.

**Jobs to be Done**:
- Review and approve AI-flagged health anomalies.
- Provide expert overrides to refine AI reasoning.
- Collaborate with AI on long-term resilience research (e.g., "Simulate impact of new vaccination protocol").

**End-User Scenarios**:
- Outbreak Response: AI alerts "Rising gill scores in Ring 14—82% confidence bacterial; recommended treatment draft ready." Veterinarian reviews images, adjusts dosage, approves execution.
- Research Insight: "Compare lice resilience across 2024-2025 batches" → AI generates analysis with visuals and trait recommendations.

## Quality Assurance & Compliance Personnel

**Goals**:
- Ensure product quality and regulatory adherence.
- Rapid incident response and trend detection.

**Motivations**:
- Pride in consumer safety and brand standards.
- Analytical satisfaction from deep insights.

**Behavior Patterns**:
- Receive AI compliance brief: "Pending release approvals; 2 minor incidents flagged."
- Query trends conversationally: "Show quality variance last quarter."

**Jobs to be Done**:
- Approve AI-generated compliance reports.
- Investigate AI-flagged deviations.

**End-User Scenarios**:
- Release Approval: AI presents batch summary with quality metrics → one-tap approve or request hold with reason.

## Farming Managers (All Levels: Global, Regional, Area)

**Goals**:
- Optimize production efficiency and biomass growth.
- Swift deviation response across areas/rings.

**Motivations**:
- Leadership impact through operational excellence.
- Reduced stress from proactive risk mitigation.

**Behavior Patterns**:
- Morning AI overview: "Holding trajectory vs plan; top risks/opportunities."
- Conversational planning: "Reschedule Ring 7 transfer for weather?"

**Jobs to be Done**:
- Review/approve AI-drafted TransferWorkflows and PlannedActivities.
- Provide strategic overrides (e.g., "Prioritize growth over early harvest").

**End-User Scenarios**:
- Deviation Handling: AI notifies "Biomass projection slipping in West area—root cause: feed disruption." Manager reviews simulation, approves adjusted plan.

## Farming Operators & Ship Personnel

**Goals**:
- Execute daily tasks safely and accurately.
- Maintain fish health during operations.

**Motivations**:
- Tangible pride in hands-on results.
- Team collaboration in challenging conditions.

**Pain Points (Mitigated)**:
- Repetitive documentation eliminated—voice reports auto-logged.

**Behavior Patterns**:
- Voice updates during rounds: "Net clean complete; minor mortality observed."
- AI guides SOPs in context (e.g., overlay on device camera).

**Jobs to be Done**:
- Confirm AI-parsed field observations.
- Handle exceptions requiring physical intervention.

**End-User Scenarios**:
- Transfer Execution: AI guides steps via voice → operator confirms completion → auto-logs conditions.

## Freshwater Managers & Operators

Parallel to Farming personas, with focus on smolt quality.

**Scenarios**:
- AI flags tank anomaly → operator voice-confirms → manager approves corrective feeding.

## Logistics Captains

**Goals**:
- Safe, timely transports with minimal stress/mortality.

**Behavior Patterns**:
- AI route/weather optimization proposals reviewed en route.

**Scenarios**:
- "Proposed delay for storm—alternative window in 36 hours?" → Captain approves.

## Finance & BI Personnel

**Goals**:
- Accurate budgeting, EoM closing, variance analysis.

**Motivations**:
- Financial precision and strategic insight.

**Behavior Patterns**:
- AI EoM preview → review variances → approve lock.

**Scenarios**:
- "Allocation complete; valuation variance explained—ready to post?"

## Executive Leadership

**Goals**:
- Strategic oversight of production, finance, sustainability.

**Scenarios**:
- Weekly AI brief: "Holding performance vs rivals; top scenarios for 2026."

## Additional/Emerging Personas

- **Broodstock Specialists**: AI-assisted trait simulation and pairing recommendations.
- **Supply Chain Managers**: AI-optimized inventory/feeding forecasts.
- **Data Analysts/R&D**: Deep conversational queries for custom insights.

This V2 persona framework shifts focus from tool usage to **expert collaboration with intelligence**. Iteration will refine trust mechanisms, override patterns, and role-specific interaction modes as prototypes emerge.
