# AquaMind Version 2: Executive Vision for an AI-Native Platform

**Date**: December 18, 2025  
**Prepared for**: Steering Committee Review  
**Status**: Visionary Roadmap (Target: H2 2026 – H1 2027)

## Executive Summary

AquaMind V1 has established a robust, data-rich foundation: a unified platform with real-time sensor integration (Wonderware/AVEVA), comprehensive audit trails, daily growth assimilation, live forward projections, transfer workflows, and emerging financial core capabilities. This positions Bakkafrost exceptionally well to lead the industry into the next wave of enterprise software – one where traditional dashboards and forms give way to **AI-native interfaces** that proactively monitor, reason, and act on the full operational dataset.

By the second half of 2026, rapid advances in multimodal large language models (e.g., projected capabilities of Grok 5 and equivalents) will enable systems that understand entire domain schemas, reason across time-series hypertables, interpret images/video, and execute guarded actions via APIs. AquaMind V2 will leverage this to transform from a **data entry and reporting tool** into a **proactive intelligent partner** that minimizes manual input, surfaces only what requires human judgment, and continuously optimizes operations.

## Core Vision for V2

AquaMind V2 will shift the primary user interface from static React dashboards and forms to an **agentic AI layer** that:

- **Monitors continuously**: Watches the full data firehose (environmental readings, assimilation states, health events, inventory flows, financial valuations) and detects anomalies, opportunities, or risks in real time.
- **Reasons contextually**: Understands the complete aquaculture lifecycle, subsidiary interdependencies, regulatory constraints, and historical patterns to provide grounded insights.
- **Acts proactively**: Auto-generates plans, workflows, and recommendations (e.g., draft TransferWorkflows from planner triggers, suggest feeding adjustments, flag early disease signals, run EoM allocations/valuations).
- **Interacts naturally**: Voice, text, or mobile-first conversational interface, with ephemeral visualizations (dynamic charts, live camera overlays, 3D ring simulations) rendered on demand.
- **Requires human oversight only at judgment points**: Users approve, veto, or refine AI proposals; routine data entry (mortality counts, environmental logs, journal notes) becomes voice/photo-assisted or fully automated where possible.

### Example Impact by Role
- **Field Operators & Ship Crew**: Voice-report observations → AI parses and logs → instant anomaly alerts with SOP guidance.
- **Veterinarians & Health Teams**: Upload gill photos or describe symptoms → AI proposes diagnosis, treatment draft, and journal entry.
- **Freshwater/Farming Managers**: Morning brief: “Three batches projected ready for transfer in 21-28 days; proposed workflows ready for review. Weather-adjusted routes included.”
- **Finance Teams**: EoM preview: “Allocation complete per 50/50 rules; valuation roll-forward shows 2.1% variance vs budget – root cause: temperature-driven FCR drift. Ready to lock?”
- **Executive Leadership**: High-level strategic summaries: “Holding-wide biomass trajectory vs plan; top three risks/opportunities; scenario forks for feed price sensitivity.”

## Why This Is Feasible in 2026–2027

- **Technological Foundation**: By mid-2026, models with million-token contexts, native tool-calling, and multimodal understanding (vision, voice) will be mature and deployable on-prem or via secure APIs.
- **AquaMind’s Unique Advantage**: Our clean, API-first architecture, rich time-series data, and deterministic rules engines (TGC/FCR/mortality models, allocation logic) provide perfect substrate for agentic reasoning – far superior to legacy systems like FishTalk.
- **Phased, Low-Risk Path**: Begin with V1.5 co-pilot (read-only insights + draft actions) in 2026, evolve to proactive agent in V1.8, reach full AI-native V2 by 2027.

## Strategic Benefits

- **Operational Efficiency**: 30-50% reduction in routine data entry and administrative burden.
- **Decision Quality**: Earlier detection, better forecasting, fewer outbreaks, optimized resource use.
- **User Adoption & Satisfaction**: Interfaces tailored to role and context; reduced cognitive load for field and managerial users.
- **Competitive Edge**: First-mover advantage in AI-native aquaculture management.

AquaMind V2 represents not just an upgrade, but a fundamental reimagining of how we manage salmon production – turning data into proactive intelligence while preserving the reliability and compliance that define Bakkafrost.
