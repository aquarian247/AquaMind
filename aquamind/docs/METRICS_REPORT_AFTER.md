## AquaMind Backend - Metrics Report (After Maintenance)

Date: 2025-09-14 (UTC)

### Executive Summary
- Maintainability improved overall: 262 files rank A, 1 file rank B.
- Cognitive complexity hotspots persist primarily in `batch` serializers/viewsets and `inventory/services/fcr_service.py`; counts concentrated in business logic, not infrastructure.
- Cyclomatic complexity highest in validation/aggregation routines; top CC functions align with known hotspots.
- UTF-8 BOM issue in `environmental/api/viewsets.py` resolved (tooling compatible).

### Key Metrics (After)
- Maintainability Index (MI):
  - Rank distribution: A: 262, B: 1
  - Worst MI files:
    - 12.76 — `apps/scenario/api/serializers.py`
    - 33.11 — `apps/operational/services/fcr_trends_service.py`
    - 33.64 — `apps/inventory/services/fcr_service.py`
    - 38.83 — `apps/infrastructure/management/commands/validate_openapi.py`
    - 39.35 — `apps/environmental/admin.py`
- Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) hotspots (top 10):
  - 18 — `infrastructure/management/commands/validate_openapi.py:validate_response_codes`
  - 17 — `operational/services/fcr_trends_service.py:_get_predicted_fcr_series`
  - 17 — `inventory/management/commands/setup_feed_recommendations.py:_setup_assignments`
  - 17 — `batch/api/serializers/growth.py:validate`
  - 16 — `inventory/api/viewsets/feeding.py:summary`
  - 15 — `scenario/services/calculations/projection_engine.py:run_projection`
  - 15 — `operational/services/fcr_trends_service.py:_get_geography_aggregated_series`
  - 15 — `health/models/health_observation.py:calculate_aggregate_metrics`
  - 14 — `inventory/api/serializers/feeding.py:validate`
  - 14 — `environmental/api/serializers.py:EnvironmentalParameterSerializer`
- Cognitive Complexity (occurrence counts by app):
  - batch: 126
  - broodstock: 39
  - environmental: 21
  - api (tests): 6
- SLOC by app (top):
  - scenario: 3666, batch: 3430, inventory: 2783, health: 2477, infrastructure: 2155

### Notable Changes vs. Previous
- Environmental BOM removed → analyzers run cleanly.
- MI distribution remains strong; worst offenders unchanged in category but show incremental improvements in some modules.

### Before vs After (Highlights)
- Max cyclomatic complexity (top hotspot): Before 24 → After 18 (improved).
- UTF-8 BOM in `environmental/api/viewsets.py`: Before present → After removed.
- Worst MI file: `scenario/api/serializers.py` 12.76 → unchanged.
- Hotspot areas (serializers, aggregation services): focus unchanged; still primary targets.

### Recommendations (Actionable)
1) Reduce cognitive complexity in `batch` serializers (growth/transfer/composition) by extracting per-field validations and early returns.
2) Decompose `inventory/services/fcr_service.py` into IO, aggregation, and formatting layers; add type hints and guard clauses.
3) Split `infrastructure/management/commands/validate_openapi.py` validation routines into smaller functions; add mapping tables over if/elif chains.
4) Track CC and MI gates in CI on changed files (CC<15; MI>50) with fail-on-regression for targeted scope.
