# AquaMind Test Data Generation Guide v6.3

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY - Hybrid Weight-Aware Deterministic Scheduling + Optimized Growth Analysis + Planned Activities**

**⚠️ THIS IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR TEST DATA GENERATION**

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Generate **realistic, production-scale test data** that:
- **Saturates infrastructure** (65-70% utilization like real farm)
- **Spans 4-5 years** of operational history (auto-calculated from constraints)
- **Includes completed + active batches** (realistic pipeline)
- **Generates 50+ million events** (environmental, feeding, mortality, growth, health)

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### Option A: Full Infrastructure Saturation (55 minutes total)

```bash
cd /Users/aquarian247/Projects/AquaMind

# 1. One-time setup (if not already done - 2 minutes total)
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_scenario_master_data.py
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_finance_policies.py
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_health_parameters.py
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_activity_templates.py

# 2. Apply database migrations (includes Growth Analysis performance indexes)
python manage.py migrate

# 3. Wipe operational data (fast with TRUNCATE)
psql aquamind_db -c "TRUNCATE TABLE batch_batch CASCADE; TRUNCATE TABLE inventory_feedpurchase CASCADE;"

# 4. Generate schedule (auto-calculates optimal batch count from constraints)
python scripts/data_generation/generate_batch_schedule.py \
  --years 4 --stagger 13 --saturation 0.85 \
  --output config/schedule_production.yaml

# 5. Execute schedule with parallel workers (45 minutes)
SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1 python scripts/data_generation/execute_batch_schedule.py \
  config/schedule_production.yaml \
  --workers 14 --use-partitions \
  --log-dir scripts/data_generation/logs/production

# 6. Run Growth Analysis recomputation (8-10 minutes)
# This computes ActualDailyAssignmentState for all batches - required for Growth Analysis charts
python scripts/data_generation/run_growth_analysis_optimized.py --workers 4

# 7. Seed Planned Activities for Production Planner (30 seconds)
# Generates PlannedActivity records across active batches for operational scheduling testing

## 📚 ARCHITECTURE

### Infrastructure Capacity

**Total Infrastructure:** 2,017 containers
- **Faroe Islands:** 1,116 containers (656 freshwater + 460 sea)
- **Scotland:** 900 containers (500 freshwater + 400 sea)
- **Test Geography:** 1 container (for testing only)

**Batch Capacity:**
- Each batch uses 10 containers per freshwater stage, 10 rings in Adult stage
- With 900-day lifecycle and 13-day stagger, containers are reused
- **Bottleneck:** Scotland sea rings (400 total, 10 per batch = max 34 concurrent Adult)
- **Auto-calculated optimal:** 72 batches per geography = 144 total
- **Constraint formula:** min(time_allows, infrastructure_allows) where infrastructure = (scotland_rings × saturation) / rings_per_batch

### The 7-Script System

#### **Script 0: Selective Wipe** (`00_wipe_operational_data.py`)
**Purpose:** Fast operational data cleanup (preserves infrastructure)  
**Time:** 1 minute

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive
python scripts/data_generation/00_wipe_operational_data.py --confirm

# Non-interactive (in scripts)
echo "DELETE" | python scripts/data_generation/00_wipe_operational_data.py --confirm
```

  --log-dir scripts/data_generation/logs/production
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Always use `SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1` during test data generation to avoid 600x slowdown!

### v5.0 Improvements (2025-11-21)

**🐛 Fixed Issues:**
- **ImportError Fix:** Removed non-existent `BatchContainerAssignmentService` import
- **Celery Avoidance:** Engine skips Growth Analysis recompute when `SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1`
- **Service Pattern:** Orchestrator uses `recompute_batch_assignments()` function instead of service class
- **Deterministic Station Assignment:** Pre-assigned stations eliminate race conditions
- **Ring Spread:** Sea transfers distribute evenly across all 20 rings per area

**✅ Success Rate:** 92.5% (37/40 batches) in recent test run
**🎯 Infrastructure Saturation:** >80% target achieved
**⚡ Performance:** No Celery overhead (600x faster than v4.0)

### ✅ v6.0: Hybrid Weight-Aware Deterministic Scheduler (IMPLEMENTED)

**🎯 Goal:** 100% success rate + realistic harvest variation through intelligent planning

**📋 Solution:** Enhanced deterministic scheduler with weight-based harvest modeling

**🔧 How It Works:**
1. **Weight-Based Planning:** Models harvest timing using TGC formula + random weight targets (4.5-6.5kg)
2. **Conservative Allocation:** Plans for worst-case duration (highest weight target) to prevent conflicts
3. **Deterministic Execution:** Uses same random seed for harvest targets across planning/execution
4. **Adaptive Saturation:** Containers freed early when batches harvest before planned end date

**✅ Perfect Compatibility:**
- **Planning:** Accounts for harvest randomness through worst-case modeling
- **Execution:** Uses identical weight targets for deterministic randomness
- **Result:** Conflict-free scheduling + realistic harvest variation

**🚀 Performance:**
- **100% success rate** (eliminated 7.5% failure rate)
- **14 parallel workers** (chronological partitioning prevents races)
- **Realistic variation:** Batches harvest at different weights/times
- **Higher utilization:** Early container freeing improves efficiency

**📊 Test Results:**
- Dry-run: ✅ Zero conflicts with weight-based modeling
- Execution: ✅ Deterministic harvest targets match between planning/execution
- Variation: ✅ Batches harvest at different times based on individual weight targets

**🎯 Commands:**
```bash
# Generate weight-aware schedule
python scripts/data_generation/generate_batch_schedule.py --batches 125 --output config/schedule_250.yaml

# Execute with deterministic harvest targets
python scripts/data_generation/execute_batch_schedule.py config/schedule_250.yaml --workers 14 --use-partitions
```

**✅ v6.0 Validation Results:**
- **100% success rate** (20/20 batches executed successfully)
- **Zero conflicts** (weight-aware planning prevents container contention)
- **Deterministic harvest targets** (planning and execution use identical random seeds)
- **Realistic variation** (different harvest times despite deterministic scheduling)

### ✅ v6.1: Production Hardening & Race Condition Elimination (2025-11-21)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready, 144/144 batches (100% success), 88.7 minutes execution time

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
1. **Batch naming race condition:** Deterministic batch_id passed from schedule
2. **Workflow naming race conditions:** CRT-{batch_number}, TRF-{batch_number}-D{day} format
3. **Post-Smolt key mismatch:** Unified to 'post_smolt' (underscore)
4. **Adult transition sea schedule:** Added missing self.sea_schedule lookup
5. **Order-based stage lookups:** Replaced 56 hardcoded names with lifecycle_stage.order

**Key Technical Details:**

**Order-Based Stage Lookups:**
- All stage checks now use `lifecycle_stage.order` instead of hardcoded names
- Order: 1=Egg&Alevin, 2=Fry, 3=Parr, 4=Smolt, 5=Post-Smolt, 6=Adult
- Example: `if batch.lifecycle_stage.order == 6:` instead of `if batch.name == 'Adult':`
- Benefits: Robust to name changes, clearer progression logic, better for migrations

**Infrastructure Constraint Calculation:**
```python
# Time constraint
max_from_time = (years × 365) / (stagger × 2)  # 4 years, 13-day stagger = 112 batches/geo

# Infrastructure constraint (Scotland sea rings bottleneck)
rings_per_batch = 10  # Post-Smolt (10) → Adult (10) = 1:1 ratio
max_concurrent_adult = (400 × 0.85) / 10 = 34 concurrent Adult batches
batches_overlapping = 450 / 13 = 35 batches overlap in Adult stage

# Result: Infrastructure-limited (35 > 34)
# Actual: 72 batches/geo works with adaptive allocation
```

**Deterministic ID Strategy:**
- Batch numbers: Passed from schedule (FAR-2020-001, SCO-2025-072)
- Creation workflows: CRT-{batch_number} (e.g., CRT-FAR-2020-001)
- Transfer workflows: TRF-{batch_number}-D{day} (e.g., TRF-FAR-2020-001-D450)
- Eliminates all query-then-increment race conditions

**Result:** 100% stable, zero conflicts, ready for production use

### ✅ v6.2: Optimized Growth Analysis Recomputation (2025-11-25)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready, 145 batches in 7.8 minutes (previously 300s+ timeout per batch)

**Problem Solved:**
- Growth Analysis recomputation was timing out during test data generation
- N+1 query pattern: ~1000 queries per batch (1 per day × multiple events)
- Each 900-day batch took 300+ seconds → unsuitable for test data generation

**Solution: Bulk Query Optimization**

1. **Database Indexes (Migration: `0038_add_growth_analysis_performance_indexes.py`):**
   - `MortalityEvent`: `(assignment, event_date)`, `(batch, event_date)`
   - `TransferAction`: `(source_assignment, actual_execution_date, status)`, `(dest_assignment, ...)`
   - `BatchContainerAssignment`: `(batch, assignment_date, departure_date)`
   - `GrowthSample`: `(assignment, sample_date)`, `(batch, sample_date)`
   - `FeedingEvent`: `(container, feeding_date)`, `(batch, feeding_date)`

2. **Bulk Query Engine (`growth_assimilation_optimized.py`):**
   - Fetches ALL events for date range in ~5 queries (vs ~1000 queries)
   - In-memory processing of daily states
   - Bulk create/update for ActualDailyAssignmentState
   - **150x speedup:** 3.2s avg per batch (vs 300s+)

3. **Stage Transition Spike Fix:**
   - Root cause: Event engine sets incorrect `avg_weight_g` on destination assignments
   - Fix: Growth assimilation now checks transfers FIRST, uses source assignment weight
   - Result: Smooth weight progression across stage transitions (no more 7x spikes)

**Performance Results:**
```
145 batches processed in 7.8 minutes (469 seconds)
937,610 ActualDailyAssignmentState records created/updated
Average: 3.2 seconds per batch
```

**Key Files:**
- `apps/batch/services/growth_assimilation_optimized.py` - Bulk query engine
- `apps/batch/migrations/0038_add_growth_analysis_performance_indexes.py` - DB indexes
- `apps/inventory/migrations/0015_add_feeding_performance_indexes.py` - Feeding indexes
- `scripts/data_generation/run_growth_analysis_optimized.py` - Standalone runner

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Always run Growth Analysis AFTER batch generation completes:
```bash
python scripts/data_generation/run_growth_analysis_optimized.py --workers 4
```

**Production Benefit:** These indexes also improve daily Celery-triggered Growth Analysis updates.

### 🎯 **The Hybrid Approach: Why It Works**

**The Fundamental Tension Resolved:**

**❌ Old Problem:** Deterministic scheduling assumed fixed durations, but weight-based harvesting created unpredictable timing → container conflicts.

**✅ New Solution:** Weight-aware deterministic scheduling models harvest randomness during planning phase.

**How It Achieves Both:**

1. **Planning Phase (Conservative):**
   - Models harvest timing using TGC formula + random weight targets
   - Plans for worst-case scenario (highest weight target = longest duration)
   - Allocates containers with conflict detection → **100% deterministic success**

2. **Execution Phase (Realistic):**
   - Uses identical random weight targets as planning phase
   - Batches harvest at different times based on individual targets
   - Containers freed early when batches harvest before planned end → **higher utilization**

3. **Result:** **Predictable scheduling + realistic variation** in perfect harmony

**Example:**
- Batch A: Plans for 6.5kg target (500 days), actually harvests at 5.2kg (420 days)
- Batch B: Plans for 6.5kg target (500 days), actually harvests at 4.8kg (380 days)
- **No conflicts:** Planning accounted for maximum duration
- **Realistic variation:** Different harvest times despite deterministic planning

## 📋 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Check (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/aquarian247/Projects/AquaMind

# Verify infrastructure exists
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=aquamind.settings python -c "
import django; django.setup()
from apps.infrastructure.models import Container, Geography

total = Container.objects.filter(active=True).count()
print(f'Total containers: {total}')
print('✅ Ready' if total > 2000 else '❌ Run 01_bootstrap_infrastructure.py first')
"
```

### Step 2: Wipe Operational Data (1 minute)

```bash
# Interactive wipe
python scripts/data_generation/00_wipe_operational_data.py --confirm
# (Type 'DELETE' when prompted)

# OR non-interactive
echo "DELETE" | python scripts/data_generation/00_wipe_operational_data.py --confirm
```

### Step 3: Initialize Scenario Master Data (30 seconds, first time only)

```bash
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_scenario_master_data.py
```

**Check if already exists:**
```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=aquamind.settings python -c "
import django; django.setup()
from apps.scenario.models import TemperatureProfile
print(f'Temperature profiles: {TemperatureProfile.objects.count()}')
print('✅ Already initialized' if TemperatureProfile.objects.count() > 0 else '❌ Run initialization script')
"
```

**Note:** Feed inventory is **auto-initialized** by event engine on first batch. No separate script needed!

### Step 4A: Test with 20 Batches (Recommended First)

```bash
# Dry run first (see plan)
python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --batches 20

# Execute (60-90 minutes)
SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1 python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py \
  --execute --batches 20 --workers 14
```

**Monitor progress:**
```bash
# In another terminal
tail -f /tmp/batch_gen_20.log

# Or check database
watch -n 60 'echo "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM batch_batch;" | psql aquamind_db'
```

### Step 4B: Scale to Full Saturation (After successful test)

```bash
# Execute full 170 batches (5-6 hours)
SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1 python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py \
  --execute --batches 85 --workers 14
```

---

## 🔑 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1 (REQUIRED!)

**Why:** Celery signal handlers try to connect to Redis after every event. Without Redis, this causes **600x slowdown** (400 minutes vs 2 minutes per batch).

**Production:** Celery enables real-time Growth Analysis updates  
**Test Data:** Celery signals cause massive performance degradation

**Solution:** 
- Set `SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1` environment variable
- Growth Analysis recomputed in bulk at orchestrator end

### 2. Feed Names Must Match Exactly

Event engine expects EXACT names:
- `Starter Feed 0.5mm` (Fry)
- `Starter Feed 1.0mm` (Parr)
- `Grower Feed 2.0mm` (Smolt)
- `Grower Feed 3.0mm` (Post-Smolt)
- `Finisher Feed 4.5mm` (Adult)
- `Finisher Feed 6.0mm` (Adult, late)

**Verification:**
```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=aquamind.settings python -c "
import django; django.setup()
from apps.inventory.models import Feed
feeds = [f.name for f in Feed.objects.all()]
print('✅ PASS' if 'Starter Feed 0.5mm' in feeds else '❌ FAIL: Run 00_wipe script')
"
```

### 3. Scenario Master Data Required

Scenarios need temperature profiles and lifecycle weight ranges. Without this:
- Projections compute but produce unrealistic results (8g adult instead of 5000g)
- Growth Analysis orange line won't work

**Run once before batch generation:**
```bash
python scripts/data_generation/01_initialize_scenario_master_data.py
```

---

## 📊 INFRASTRUCTURE SATURATION MODEL

### How Batches Utilize Infrastructure

**Container Reuse Pattern:**
- Each batch progresses through 6 stages
- Each stage uses ~10 containers
- Stage transitions every 90 days
- Containers released after stage transition (reused by other batches)

**30-Day Stagger Effect:**
```
Day   0: Batch 1 occupies Hall-A (Egg&Alevin)
Day  30: Batch 2 occupies Hall-A, Batch 1 moves to Hall-B
Day  60: Batch 3 occupies Hall-A, Batch 2 in Hall-B, Batch 1 in Hall-C
Day  90: Batch 4 occupies Hall-A, Batch 1 transitions to Hall-D (Hall-A released)
```

**Result:** Each set of 10 containers can support ~30 batches over their lifecycles.

### Saturation Calculation

```
Total containers: 2,017
Containers per batch (avg): 10-20 (depending on stage)
Container reuse factor: ~30x (over 900-day lifecycle with 30-day stagger)

Theoretical max: 2,017 × 0.85 ÷ 10 ≈ 171 active batches
Actual target: 170 batches (85 per geography)
```

**At any given moment:**
- ~60-80 batches active (various stages)
- ~90-110 batches completed (harvested)
- ~1,500-1,700 containers occupied (85% utilization)

## 📈 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS

### Event Engine (Single Batch)

| Duration | Events | Time (w/ SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS) | DB Size |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 200 days | ~40K | 2 min | ~50 MB |
| 550 days | ~150K | 5 min | ~150 MB |
| 900 days | ~300K | 8 min | ~400 MB |

**Without SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS:** 400+ min per batch (600x slower!) ❌

### Parallel Orchestrator (Multi-Batch)

| Batches | Completed | Active | Time (14 workers) | DB Size | Events |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| 40 (20/geo) | ~25 | ~15 | 60-90 min | 15-20 GB | ~10M |
| 80 (40/geo) | ~50 | ~30 | 2-3 hours | 40-50 GB | ~20M |
| 170 (85/geo) | ~112 | ~58 | 5-6 hours | 80-100 GB | ~50M |

**Speedup:** ~10-12x vs sequential (I/O-bound, not CPU-bound)

**M4 Max (16-core, 128GB RAM) Performance:**
- 14 workers recommended (leave 2 cores for system/DB)
- CPU utilization: 20-40% (I/O-bound workload)
- Database is the bottleneck (transaction locks, disk writes)

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "No feeding events created"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=aquamind.settings python -c "
import django; django.setup()
from apps.inventory.models import Feed, FeedingEvent
from apps.batch.models import Batch

batch = Batch.objects.latest('created_at')
feeding = FeedingEvent.objects.filter(batch=batch).count()
feeds = Feed.objects.all().values_list('name', flat=True)

print(f'Feeding events: {feeding}')
print(f'Feeds in DB: {list(feeds)}')
print('✅ Feed names correct' if 'Starter Feed 0.5mm' in feeds else '❌ Wrong feed names')
"
```

**Fix:** Run `echo "DELETE" | python scripts/data_generation/00_wipe_operational_data.py --confirm`

### Issue: "GrowthAssimilationEngine: No scenario available"

**Cause:** Batch doesn't have associated scenario (required for Growth Analysis)

**When this happens:**
- Very young batches (< 180 days, before Parr stage)
- Scenario creation occurs at Day 180

**Not an error** - expected for batches < 180 days old.

### Issue: Parallel generation seems slow / not using all CPUs

**Expected behavior:**
- Workload is **I/O-bound** (database operations), not CPU-bound
- CPU utilization: 20-40% (not 100%)
- Database is the bottleneck (Postgres transaction locks)
- **Still 10-12x faster** than sequential despite low CPU%

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check active workers
ps aux | grep "03_event_engine_core.py" | wc -l
# Should show 14 during execution

# Check database connections
echo "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';" | psql aquamind_db
```

### Issue: "Unusually high FCR=10.83" warnings

**Not an error!** These are normal in early feeding days:
- FCR caps at 10.0 for data quality
- Early Fry stage has unstable FCR (small fish, imprecise feeding)
- FCR stabilizes by Parr stage (1.0-1.5 range)

**Ignore these warnings** - they indicate the FCR capping system is working correctly.

### Issue: Out of disk space

**170 batches = 80-100 GB database**

**Check available space:**
```bash
df -h | grep /dev/disk
```

**Minimum required:** 150 GB free (database + logs + temp files)

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Historical vs Date-Bounded

**Historical Start Dates:**
- Auto-calculated from: `--years × 365 days` (default: 4 years = 1,460 days)
- With 13-day stagger: Spans 5.2 years (accounts for batch spread + buffer)
- For 72 batches/geo with 13-day stagger: Goes back to 2020-08-30
- Creates mix of completed + active batches

**Date-Bounded Execution:**
- Each batch runs: `min(900 days, days_since_start)`
- Old batches: Full 900-day cycle (completed, harvested)
- Recent batches: Partial cycle (active in various stages)

**Example (72 batches per geography with 13-day stagger):**
```
Batch 1:  Start 2020-08-30 → Duration 900 days → Completed ✅
Batch 60: Start 2022-11-25 → Duration 900 days → Completed ✅
Batch 65: Start 2023-08-15 → Duration 830 days → Active (Adult stage)
Batch 72: Start 2025-09-19 → Duration 63 days → Active (Fry)
```

**Infrastructure Constraint Formula:**
```python
# Time-based: How many batches fit in timespan?
max_from_time = (years × 365) / (stagger × 2)  # Divided by 2 for interleaved geos

# Infrastructure-based: Scotland sea rings are bottleneck
rings_per_batch = 10  # Post-Smolt (10) → Adult (10) = 1:1 ratio
max_concurrent_adult = (400 × saturation) / rings_per_batch
batches_would_overlap = adult_duration / stagger  # 450 / 13 = 35

# If overlap > capacity, infrastructure-limited
if batches_would_overlap > max_concurrent_adult:
    max_batches = max_concurrent_adult  # Infrastructure limit
else:
    max_batches = max_from_time  # Time limit

# For our setup: 35 overlap > 34 capacity → infrastructure-limited at 34 batches/geo
# But scheduler adjusts upward when testing shows it can fit more
```

### 2. Parallel Execution is I/O-Bound

**Don't expect 100% CPU utilization** - the bottleneck is:
- Database writes (Postgres transaction locks)
- Disk I/O (millions of records)
- Network overhead (if DB on remote host)

**Still provides 10-12x speedup** through concurrent I/O operations.

### 3. Growth Analysis Requires Scenarios

The Growth Assimilation Engine requires scenarios for TGC/mortality models:
- **Scenarios created at Day 1** with 760-day projection (reaches ~6kg harvest weight)
- Uses industry-standard cube-root TGC formula (Iwama & Tautz 1981)
- Stage-specific TGC values: Fry(2.25), Parr(2.75), Adult(3.1)
- Projects realistic S-curve growth avoiding theoretical weight caps
- All batches have scenarios immediately (no minimum age requirement)

### 4. Celery Performance Impact

**Production System:**
```
Operator records event → Signal fires → Celery task → Background recompute
```

**Test Data Generation:**
```
Event engine creates 10,000 events → 10,000 signal attempts → 10,000 Redis failures → 600x slowdown
```

**Always use `SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1`** for test data generation!

### 5. Infrastructure Saturation is Realistic

**Real salmon farms operate at:**
- 80-90% capacity (maximize assets, minimize waste)
- Multiple batches in different stages (continuous operation)
- Container reuse (batches transition through facilities)

**Our model mirrors this:** 85% saturation with 170 batches across 2,017 containers.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES

### ❌ Mistake 1: Forgetting SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS
```bash
# WRONG - Will take 40+ hours
python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --execute --batches 85

# CORRECT - Takes 5-6 hours
SKIP_CELERY_SIGNALS=1 python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --execute --batches 85
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using Sequential Orchestrator
```bash
# SLOW - 40+ hours

# FAST - 5-6 hours
python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --execute --batches 85 --workers 14
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Too Few Batches
```bash
# INCOMPLETE - Only 20 batches, 5% of data volume
python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --execute --batches 10

# REALISTIC - 170 batches, full infrastructure saturation
python scripts/data_generation/04_batch_orchestrator_parallel.py --execute --batches 85
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Skipping Scenario Initialization

## 🔧 TECHNICAL REFERENCE

### Order-Based Stage Lookups

**All scripts use `lifecycle_stage.order` instead of hardcoded names for robustness.**

**Stage Order Mapping:**
```
1 = Egg&Alevin (no feeding, 90 days)
2 = Fry (freshwater, 90 days)
3 = Parr (freshwater, 90 days)
4 = Smolt (freshwater, 90 days)
5 = Post-Smolt (seawater, 90 days)
6 = Adult (seawater, 450 days, harvested)
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Correct: Order-based checks
if batch.lifecycle_stage.order == 6:  # Adult stage
if 2 <= stage.order <= 4:  # Freshwater stages (Fry, Parr, Smolt)
if stage.order >= 5:  # Seawater stages (Post-Smolt, Adult)

# Wrong: Hardcoded names (fragile)
if batch.lifecycle_stage.name == 'Adult':  # Breaks if name changes
```

**Benefits:** Robust to name changes, clearer progression, migration-safe.

---

### Deterministic ID Strategy

**All entity IDs are deterministic to eliminate race conditions in parallel execution.**

| Entity | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Batch | From schedule | FAR-2020-001, SCO-2025-072 |
| Creation Workflow | CRT-{batch_number} | CRT-FAR-2020-001 |
| Transfer Workflow | TRF-{batch_number}-D{day} | TRF-FAR-2020-001-D450 |

**Critical Rule:** Never query-then-increment in parallel code. Always pass predetermined IDs.

---

### Infrastructure Capacity Calculation

**Scheduler auto-calculates maximum batches from time AND infrastructure constraints:**

```python
# Time constraint
years = 4; stagger = 13
max_from_time = (years × 365) / (stagger × 2) = 56 batches/geo

# Infrastructure constraint (Scotland sea rings = bottleneck)
scotland_rings = 400; rings_per_batch = 10; saturation = 0.85
max_concurrent_adult = (400 × 0.85) / 10 = 34 batches
overlap_in_adult = 450 / 13 = 35 batches

# Result: Infrastructure-limited (35 > 34)
# Actual: 72 batches/geo validated through testing
```

---

### Schedule File Structure

**Generated by `generate_batch_schedule.py`, consumed by `execute_batch_schedule.py`.**

**Critical Details:**
- Stage keys use underscores: `egg_alevin`, `post_smolt` (NOT hyphens!)
- Each batch has `freshwater` dict (5 stages) and `sea` dict (rings list)
- Worker partitions for chronological parallel execution
