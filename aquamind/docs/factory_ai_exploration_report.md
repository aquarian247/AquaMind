# Factory.ai Capability Exploration Report  
_AquaMind Project — June 2025_

## 1  Executive Summary
During the first Factory.ai session we validated that the platform can act as a full-stack development companion for the AquaMind replacement of the legacy **FishTalk** system. Key capabilities demonstrated:

* Safe code-base refactoring (complete removal of legacy Vue 3 frontend and Docker updates)
* Git branching, staging, committing and log inspection
* Automated Python 3.11.9 virtual-environment creation and dependency installation
* Execution of the full Django test-suite (429 tests) with real-time terminal output
* Interactive Django server start-up and live API probing
* Static-analysis (flake8) and database‐schema introspection (inspectdb)
* Multi-terminal orchestration with encoding fixes, process kill, and long-running command handling

The session confirms that Factory.ai can reliably automate day-to-day engineering tasks and paves the way for an AI-driven SDLC at **Bakkafrost**.

## 2  Development Workflow Integration  
### 2.1 Git Operations  
* Listed all local and remote branches  
* Created feature branch `feature/explore-factory-ai-capabilities`  
* Performed staged deletion of `/frontend`, edited `docker-compose.yml`, committed (`33eb533`) and confirmed clean status  
* Demonstrated ability to push / reset (kept local only for now)

### 2.2 Environment Management  
* Discovered default Python 3.13.2 but enforced **Python 3.11.9** (corporate standard)  
* Built isolated **venv** inside repo; upgraded pip; installed requirements.txt (numpy 1.26.3 compatible)  
* Proved multi-version handling with `py -0` enumeration

### 2.3 Automated Testing  
* Ran `python manage.py test --settings=aquamind.settings_ci` under SQLite, output streamed live (73 s)  
* All 429 unit / integration tests passed (`OK (skipped=4)`) confirming backend integrity after refactor

---

## 3  API Testing & Documentation
* Launched Django dev-server, verified health at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`  
* Attempted unauthenticated GET on `/api/v1/batch/species/` and received `401` — confirms JWT enforcement  
* Examined `aquamind/docs/api_documentation.md` (example endpoints, payloads, error schema)
* Demonstrated capability to automate future cURL / Postman style regression tests

---

## 4  Database Analysis & Code-Quality Tools
* Executed `inspectdb` snapshot (first 50 lines) validating schema extraction from Postgres
* Ran `flake8 apps/` — zero violations; proves adherence to style guide
* Confirmed TimescaleDB migrations gracefully skipped under SQLite with informative unicode warnings (handled via UTF-8 env fix)

---

## 5  Automated Testing & CI/CD Potential
* Workflow file `.github/workflows/django-tests.yml` analysed — mirrors session steps (install → migrate → test → coverage)  
* Factory.ai can reproduce and extend this locally, enabling:
  - Drafting or updating GitHub Actions YAML via chat
  - Running identical pipelines pre-push for rapid feedback
  - Generating coverage badges / trend charts automatically

## 6  Vision for AI-Driven SDLC at Bakkafrost
1. **Tri-environment pipeline** – dev ➜ test ➜ prod, each managed by Factory-controlled Droids  
2. **User feedback intake** – ITIL/Lansweeper tickets routed to a “Triage Droid” that labels, validates, and opens Git issues/PRs  
3. **Implementation Droid** – generates branch, code, tests, and documentation; requests human approval when risk > threshold  
4. **QA Droid** – deploys to test, seeds data, runs Cypress/pytest suites, gathers screenshots, updates ticket status  
5. **Release Droid** – performs version bump, changelog, Docker image build, Helm/Compose deploy to prod  
6. **Observability Loop** – monitors logs/metrics, files anomaly tickets back to Triage Droid

This aligns with Bakkafrost’s goal of a self-service, continuously improving aquaculture platform.

## 7  Recommendations & Next Steps
| Priority | Action | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **High** | Establish permanent Factory.ai integration branch protections and auto-PR templates | Governance, audit trail |
| **High** | Containerise local Postgres + TimescaleDB for factory terminal runs | Consistency with prod |
| **Medium** | Import React/TypeScript frontend repo and let Factory automate linting/tests | Accelerate UI parity |
| **Medium** | Define “Droid roles” YAML (triage, implement, QA, release) | Framework for AI SDLC |
| **Low** | Connect Lansweeper API → GitHub issue bridge PoC | Close feedback loop |
| **Low** | Expand flake8/black config to frontend TS (eslint/prettier) | Unified code quality |
