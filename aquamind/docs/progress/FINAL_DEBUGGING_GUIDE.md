# Final Debugging Guide - History Tab Issues

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: 🔍 DEBUGGING

---

## 🐛 **Current Issues**

### **1. Variable Reference Error (FIXED ✅)**
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: batchMortalityEvents is not defined
```

**Cause**: Variable renamed from `batchMortalityEvents` to `mortalityEvents` but one reference wasn't updated

**Fix**: Changed line 727 to use `mortalityEvents`

---

### **2. Lifecycle Chart Empty (INVESTIGATING 🔍)**
```
📊 LIFECYCLE DATA FOR CHART: {
  assignmentsByStageKeys: Array(0),    ← EMPTY!
  lifecycleDataLength: 0,
  lifecycleData: Array(0)
}
```

**But we have**:
- ✅ 60 assignments fetched
- ✅ Stages fetched
- ❌ Grouping by stage returns 0 groups

**Possible Causes**:
1. Stages array is empty when grouping happens
2. Stage IDs don't match between assignments and stages
3. Nested object structure mismatch

---

## 🔍 **Debug Steps**

### **After Refresh, Check Console For**:

#### **1. Stages Loading**:
```
✅ Stages fetched: {count: 6, resultsLength: 6}
```
**If resultsLength is 0**: Stages API call failed

#### **2. Stage Matching Warnings**:
```
⚠️ Stage not found for assignment: {
  assignmentId: 5456,
  stageId: 6,
  lifecycleStageField: {id: 6, name: "Adult"},
  availableStages: [{id: 1, name: "Egg&Alevin"}, ...]
}
```
**If you see this**: Stage IDs don't match

#### **3. Successful Grouping**:
```
📊 LIFECYCLE DATA FOR CHART: {
  assignmentsByStageKeys: ['Egg&Alevin', 'Fry', 'Parr', 'Smolt', 'Post-Smolt', 'Adult'],
  lifecycleDataLength: 6,
  lifecycleData: [...]
}
```
**If you see this**: Lifecycle chart should render!

---

## 🎯 **Expected Database Reality**

Batch 206 has:
- ✅ 10 assignments in Egg&Alevin
- ✅ 10 assignments in Fry
- ✅ 10 assignments in Parr
- ✅ 10 assignments in Smolt
- ✅ 10 assignments in Post-Smolt
- ✅ 10 assignments in Adult

**Total**: 60 assignments across 6 stages

---

## 🔧 **Potential Fixes**

### **If stages array is empty**:
- Check if stages API call completed successfully
- Check for authentication errors

### **If stage IDs don't match**:
- Verify nested object extraction
- Check if assignment.lifecycle_stage is {id: 6} or just 6

### **If nothing shows in warnings**:
- Assignments might be filtered out before grouping
- Check `batchAssignments` has 60 items before reduce

## 📊 **What to Share**

After refresh, copy from console:
1. The `⚠️ Stage not found` warnings (if any)
2. The `📊 LIFECYCLE DATA FOR CHART` log
3. The `✅ Stages fetched` log
4. Any errors

This will help identify exactly where the grouping is breaking!
