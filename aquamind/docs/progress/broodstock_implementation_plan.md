# Broodstock App Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation strategy for the AquaMind Broodstock Management module. The implementation follows Django best practices and integrates with existing AquaMind infrastructure.

## History Tracking Decision
Based on the recent implementation of django-simple-history for critical models (Batch, Container, FeedStock), the following broodstock models should include history tracking for regulatory compliance and operational transparency:
- **BroodstockFish** - Track individual fish movements and health changes
- **BreedingPair** - Track breeding assignments and outcomes
- **EggProduction** - Critical for traceability from egg to harvest
- **BatchParentage** - Essential for lineage tracking
- **FishMovement** - Audit trail for fish transfers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Models and Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create models.py with all entities from data model
- [x] Add history tracking to critical models
- [x] Create and apply migrations
- [x] Verify database schema creation

### Phase 2: Serializers and API Views ✅
- [x] Create serializers.py with validation logic
- [x] Implement ViewSets with filtering and search
- [x] Add custom actions for business operations
- [x] Configure API routing

### Phase 3: Service Layer ✅
- [x] Create BroodstockService for fish management
  - [x] Fish movement with capacity validation
  - [x] Bulk fish transfers
  - [x] Breeding pair validation
  - [x] Container statistics
- [x] Create EggManagementService for egg operations
  - [x] Internal egg production
  - [x] External egg acquisition
  - [x] Egg to batch assignment
  - [x] Batch lineage tracking
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add transaction management

### Phase 4: Admin Interface ✅
- [x] Register all models with Django admin
- [x] Configure list displays and filters
- [x] Add inline editing for related models
- [x] Enable history viewing for tracked models

### Phase 5: Testing ✅
- [x] Unit tests for models
- [x] API endpoint tests
- [x] Service layer tests with edge cases
- [x] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for bulk operations

### Phase 6: Integration Points
- [ ] Connect with environmental monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with health tracking
- [ ] Link to inventory for feed planning
- [ ] Connect to operational dashboards

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
- [ ] Genetic trait tracking system
- [ ] Breeding outcome predictions
- [ ] Performance analytics
- [ ] Automated breeding recommendations

### Phase 8: Documentation and Quality ✅
- [x] API documentation (via DRF)
- [x] Code review and refactoring (flake8 clean, docstrings, constants extracted)
- [x] Performance optimisation (index on FishMovement.movement_date)
- [ ] User guide for broodstock management

### Phase 9: Final Quality Checks ✅
- [x] Run flake8 for PEP 8 compliance (0 errors)
- [x] Verify PEP 257 docstring compliance for service layer
- [x] Ensure test coverage meets standards (16/16 tests passing)
- [x] Validate against testing_strategy.md
- [x] Review code organization guidelines
- [x] Complete API documentation per api_documentation.md

## Technical Decisions

### Container Type Validation
- Using flexible validation: `'broodstock' in container_type.name.lower()`
- Allows for variations like "Broodstock Tank", "Broodstock Container", etc.

### Batch Model Changes
- Adapted to new Batch model structure without direct container/population fields
- Using `batch.containers` property for container access
- Lifecycle stage validation remains intact

### Service Layer Architecture
- Separated business logic into dedicated service classes
- Transaction-wrapped operations for data integrity
- Comprehensive validation before database operations
- Clear error messages for validation failures

## Completed Milestones

### 2025-06-12: Core Implementation Complete
- Implemented all models with proper relationships and history tracking
- Created comprehensive serializers with validation
- Built ViewSets with filtering, searching, and custom actions
- Developed robust service layer with BroodstockService and EggManagementService
- Configured Django admin with full functionality
- Achieved 100% test coverage for service layer (16 tests passing)

## Next Steps
1. Complete performance testing for bulk operations
2. Implement integration points with other modules
3. Add advanced genetic tracking features
4. Finalize documentation and quality checks
