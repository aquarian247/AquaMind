- Mortality biomass note: FishTalk source biomass is zero/missing for this batch; AquaMind mortality biomass is derived from status/assignment context. This row is informational and is not a regression gate criterion.

## Lifecycle Stage Sanity

- Mixed-batch composition rows: 0
- Known removal count (mortality + culling + escapes + harvest): 39702
- Stage-entry window used for transition sanity: 2 day(s)
- Lineage fallback max depth: 14 hop(s).
- Bridge-aware transitions using lineage-graph fallback: 0
- Assignment zero-count rows (population_count <= 0): 2 total, 2 bridge-classified, 0 same-stage superseded-zero, 0 short-lived orphan-zero, 0 no-count-evidence-zero, 0 known-loss-depleted-zero, 0 non-bridge.
- Transfer actions with transferred_count <= 0: 0 of 7.
- Fishgroup classification: 4 temporary bridge fishgroups, 1 real stage-entry fishgroups, 4 temporary bridge populations.

| Stage | Entry population | Active population | Peak concurrent population | Full summed population | Full/entry ratio | Full/peak ratio | Entry date | Entry window end | Entry containers | Real entry fishgroups | Bridge fishgroups excluded | Non-zero assignments | Total assignments |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

- Transition deltas below use bridge-aware linked source populations when available (counts prefer SubTransfer-conserved values, fallback to assignment counts); otherwise they fall back to stage entry-window populations.

### Fishgroup Classification Samples

- Temporary bridge fishgroup examples: `232.0003`, `232.0006`, `232.0007`, `23A.0001`
- Real stage-entry fishgroup examples: `232.0002`

### Fishgroup Format Audit

- Tuple format check: `Fishgroup == InputYear + InputNumber + '.' + RunningNumber(4-digit)`
| Scope | Rows checked | Matched | Matched % | Outliers | Allowlisted outliers | Non-allowlisted outliers |

- Outlier allowlist patterns: `23|99|23999.000`

### Outside-Component Destination Evidence

- This evidence is derived from SubTransfers graph links and grouped-organisation context; it indicates destinations outside the selected stitched population set.
- Marine linkage evidence: NO
- Direct external destination populations (any role): 3

| SubTransfer role evidence | External edge count | Destination prod stages | Destination sites |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| SourcePopBefore -> DestPopAfter | 0 | - | - |
| SourcePopBefore -> SourcePopAfter | 3 | Hatchery:3 | S04 Húsar:3 |
| DestPopBefore -> DestPopAfter | 0 | - | - |

| Destination set | Populations | Marine populations | By prod stage | By site | By site group |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct external populations | 3 | 0 | Hatchery:3 | S04 Húsar:3 | Unknown:3 |
| Reachable outside descendants | 6 | 0 | Hatchery:6 | S04 Húsar:6 | Unknown:6 |

### Regression Gates

| Gate | Result | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no_positive_transition_delta_without_mixed_batch` | PASS | Positive stage transition deltas without mixed-batch composition rows: 0 (excluded incomplete-linkage fallback rows: 0) |
| `no_zero_count_transfer_actions` | PASS | Transfer actions with transferred_count <= 0: 0 |
| `non_bridge_zero_assignments_within_threshold` | PASS | Assignments with population_count <= 0 after excluding temporary bridge, same-stage superseded-zero, short-lived orphan-zero, no-count-evidence-zero, and known-loss-depleted-zero rows: 0 (threshold: 2) |
- Overall gate result: PASS (enforced)
