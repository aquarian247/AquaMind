## Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Bug 1: Cancelled Activities Can Be Marked Completed

**Severity**: 🟡 **MODERATE** (Logical inconsistency, data integrity)

**Description**:  
The `mark_completed()` method and API action only checked if activity was already COMPLETED but didn't reject CANCELLED activities. This allowed semantically incorrect state transition from CANCELLED to COMPLETED, enabling users to "un-cancel" activities.

**Impact**:
- Cancelled activities could be marked as completed
- Inconsistent with spawn_transfer_workflow validation
- Violates state machine logic (cancellation should be terminal)
- Audit trail would show illogical status transitions

**Root Cause**:
```python
# BEFORE (buggy code)
def mark_completed(self, user):
    """Mark activity as completed."""
    self.status = 'COMPLETED'  # No validation!
    self.completed_at = timezone.now()
    self.completed_by = user
    self.save()
```

**Fix**:
```python
# AFTER (fixed code)
def mark_completed(self, user):
    """Mark activity as completed."""
    if self.status == 'COMPLETED':
        raise ValueError("Activity is already completed")
    
    if self.status == 'CANCELLED':
        raise ValueError("Cannot complete a cancelled activity")
    
    self.status = 'COMPLETED'
    self.completed_at = timezone.now()
    self.completed_by = user
    self.save()
```

**Test Coverage**:
```python
def test_mark_completed_raises_error_for_cancelled_activity(self):
    """CRITICAL: Cannot mark cancelled activities as completed."""
    activity = PlannedActivity.objects.create(
        status='CANCELLED',
        ...
    )
    
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
        activity.mark_completed(user=self.user)
    
    self.assertIn('Cannot complete a cancelled activity', str(context.exception))

def test_mark_completed_action_rejects_cancelled_activity(self):
    """CRITICAL: API must reject marking cancelled activities as completed."""
    # API-level test verifying 400 Bad Request response
```

**Result**: ✅ Cancelled activities now properly rejected from completion

---

### Bug 2: Missing Null Check for Template Trigger Fields

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** (Would cause TypeError at runtime)

**Description**:  
The `ActivityTemplate.generate_activity()` method used `self.day_offset` directly in `timedelta(days=self.day_offset)` without checking if it was None. Since `day_offset` is a nullable field (`null=True, blank=True`), creating a template with `trigger_type='DAY_OFFSET'` but no `day_offset` value would cause a TypeError when generating activities.

**Impact**:
- Auto-generation signal handler would crash
- API endpoint `generate-for-batch` would return 500 error
- Template system would be unreliable

**Root Cause**:
```python
# BEFORE (buggy code)
elif self.trigger_type == 'DAY_OFFSET':
    due_date = batch.created_at.date() + timedelta(days=self.day_offset)  # TypeError if None!
```

**Fix**:
```python
# AFTER (fixed code)
elif self.trigger_type == 'DAY_OFFSET':
    if self.day_offset is None:
        raise ValueError("day_offset is required for DAY_OFFSET trigger type")
    due_date = batch.created_at.date() + timedelta(days=self.day_offset)
```

**Additional Validations Added**:
- `weight_threshold_g` required for WEIGHT_THRESHOLD trigger
- `target_lifecycle_stage` required for STAGE_TRANSITION trigger

**Test Coverage**:
```python
def test_generate_activity_raises_error_for_missing_day_offset(self):
    """CRITICAL: Template must validate day_offset when trigger_type is DAY_OFFSET."""
    template = ActivityTemplate.objects.create(
        name='Invalid Template',
        activity_type='VACCINATION',
        trigger_type='DAY_OFFSET',
        day_offset=None,  # Missing required field
        is_active=True
    )
    
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
        template.generate_activity(scenario=self.scenario, batch=self.batch)
    
    self.assertIn('day_offset is required', str(context.exception))
```

**Result**: ✅ Template generation now safely validates all trigger fields

---

### Bug 3: Workflow Spawning Without Status Validation

**Severity**: 🟡 **MODERATE** (Data integrity issue, not crash)

**Description**:  
The `PlannedActivity.spawn_transfer_workflow()` method unconditionally set `status = 'IN_PROGRESS'` without validating the current status. This allowed spawning workflows on COMPLETED or CANCELLED activities, which would overwrite their status and create logical inconsistencies (e.g., "de-completing" a finished activity).

**Impact**:
- Completed activities could be "un-completed"
- Cancelled activities could be "un-cancelled"
- Audit trail would show illogical status transitions
- Reporting metrics would be inaccurate

**Root Cause**:
```python
# BEFORE (buggy code)
def spawn_transfer_workflow(self, workflow_type, source_lifecycle_stage, dest_lifecycle_stage):
    if self.activity_type != 'TRANSFER':
        raise ValueError("Can only spawn workflows from TRANSFER activities")
    
    if self.transfer_workflow:
        raise ValueError("Workflow already spawned for this activity")
    
    # Missing status validation here!
    
    # ... create workflow ...
    
    self.status = 'IN_PROGRESS'  # Overwrites any status!
    self.save()
```

**Fix**:
```python
# AFTER (fixed code)
def spawn_transfer_workflow(self, workflow_type, source_lifecycle_stage, dest_lifecycle_stage):
    if self.activity_type != 'TRANSFER':
        raise ValueError("Can only spawn workflows from TRANSFER activities")
    
    if self.transfer_workflow:
        raise ValueError("Workflow already spawned for this activity")
    
    # NEW: Validate status before spawning
    if self.status not in ['PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS']:
        raise ValueError(f"Cannot spawn workflow for activity with status {self.status}")
    
    # ... create workflow ...
    
    self.status = 'IN_PROGRESS'  # Now safe to set
    self.save()
```

**Test Coverage**:
```python
def test_spawn_transfer_workflow_raises_error_for_completed_activity(self):
    """CRITICAL: Cannot spawn workflow from completed or cancelled activities."""
    activity = PlannedActivity.objects.create(
        scenario=self.scenario,
        batch=self.batch,
        activity_type='TRANSFER',
        due_date=timezone.now().date(),
        status='COMPLETED',  # Already completed
        created_by=self.user
    )
    
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
        activity.spawn_transfer_workflow(...)

def test_spawn_transfer_workflow_raises_error_for_cancelled_activity(self):
    """CRITICAL: Cannot spawn workflow from cancelled activities."""
    # Similar test for CANCELLED status
```

**Result**: ✅ Workflow spawning now validates activity is in appropriate state

## Validation Rules Summary

### ActivityTemplate Validations

| Trigger Type | Required Field | Validation |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| `DAY_OFFSET` | `day_offset` | Must not be None |
| `WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` | `weight_threshold_g` | Must not be None |
| `STAGE_TRANSITION` | `target_lifecycle_stage` | Must not be None |

### PlannedActivity Validations

| Operation | Current Status | Validation |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| `spawn_transfer_workflow()` | Must be PENDING or IN_PROGRESS | Rejects COMPLETED/CANCELLED |
| `mark_completed()` | Must not be COMPLETED or CANCELLED | Prevents double-completion and completing cancelled activities |

## Prevention of Future Issues

### At Model Level
- Clear validation with descriptive error messages
- Fail-fast approach (validate early)
- Type-safe field access with explicit None checks

### At API Level
- Validation errors return 400 Bad Request
- Error messages guide users to fix issues
- API consumers get clear feedback

### At Test Level
- Edge case tests prevent regressions
- Both happy path and error path covered
- Fast feedback during development

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Nullable Fields Need Validation
When fields are nullable but required for specific logic paths, always validate before use.

**Pattern**:
```python
if self.trigger_type == 'DAY_OFFSET':
    if self.day_offset is None:
        raise ValueError("day_offset is required for DAY_OFFSET trigger type")
    # Safe to use self.day_offset now
```

### 2. Status Transitions Need Guards
State machines should validate current state before allowing transitions.

**Pattern**:
```python
if self.status not in ['PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS']:
    raise ValueError(f"Cannot perform action in status {self.status}")
# Safe to transition now
```

### 3. Test Edge Cases
Don't just test happy paths - test what happens with None values, wrong statuses, and boundary conditions.

## Impact Analysis

### User Experience
- ✅ **Better**: Clear error messages instead of cryptic TypeErrors
- ✅ **Safer**: Cannot accidentally overwrite completed activities
- ✅ **Clearer**: API responses guide users to fix issues

### Developer Experience
- ✅ **Easier Debugging**: ValueError with context vs. TypeError in timedelta
- ✅ **Self-Documenting**: Validation logic makes requirements explicit
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Edge cases caught before production

### System Reliability
- ✅ **No Runtime Crashes**: Validation prevents TypeError
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Status transitions are logically consistent
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: No illogical status changes in history
