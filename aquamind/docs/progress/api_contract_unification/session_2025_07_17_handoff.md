# Session Handoff – **2025-07-17**

## 1. What we did on 2025-07-16

* Investigated persistent Schemathesis “ignored_auth” & status-code failures.
* Confirmed global `security:` block **is** present in `api/openapi.yaml`.
* Root cause of lingering anonymous access → operation-level `- {}` entries produced by drf-spectacular.
* Implemented enhancement in  
  `aquamind/utils/openapi_utils.py → cleanup_duplicate_security()`  
  • Removes empty `{}` from *all* operations **except** the two auth endpoints  
  • Also deduplicates repeated schemes.
* Regenerated schema & committed:
  * Only `/api/v1/auth/token/` & `/api/v1/auth/dev-auth/` retain `{}` (intended).
* Pushed branch `feature/api-contract-unification`.

## 2. Current Schemathesis state

* CI run `16321368520` still **failing** at “Validate API contract with Schemathesis”.
* Collected ops: 392
* Earliest failures:
  * `POST /api/v1/auth/token/` – 400 responses (bad creds fuzz) flagged as **status_code_conformance**.
  * `GET /api/v1/auth/dev-auth/` – still reported under **ignored_auth** despite correct `{}` in spec.
  * Several 404s for legacy `/api/v1/infrastructure/…` paths (these endpoints were renamed; routes missing).

## 3. Fixed / verified

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Global security block | ✅ present (`[{'tokenAuth': []}]`) |
| Removal of stray `{}` | ✅ completed via new hook |
| Pagination edge-case validation | ✅ custom `ValidatedPageNumberPagination` in use |
| CI user perms & token generation | ✅ user is superuser, token generated (len 40) |

## 4. Still not working

1. Schemathesis still marks many ops as **ignored_auth** even though spec now requires auth. Need to confirm CLI header injection (`Authorization: Token $TOKEN`) works for *every* request.
2. Status-code failures for auth endpoints (400 ≠ 2xx expected). We may need to allow 400 in schema or configure Schemathesis to skip those.
3. Numerous 404s for paths under `/api/v1/infrastructure/*` – routes were moved to `/api/v1/batch/*` etc.; schema outdated for router mappings.
4. CI step exits with code 1 after first failures; no full report presently.

## 5. Next steps

1. **Re-run Schemathesis locally** with `--auth` header and observe which requests miss the header.
2. Add a **pre-test probe**: log headers received by DRF (`request.META['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']`) to ensure token arrives.
3. Update routers / urls:
   * Remove legacy `infrastructure` URL patterns or update OpenAPI tags.
4. Consider adding `422`, `400` to acceptable responses for auth endpoints via `@extend_schema`.
5. If failures persist, capture minimal failing case (`schemathesis reproduce …`) and debug view permissions.

## 6. Key files & locations

* `aquamind/utils/openapi_utils.py` – new hook logic lines ~70-110.
* `aquamind/settings.py` & `settings_ci.py` – POSTPROCESSING_HOOKS list.
* `api/openapi.yaml` – regenerated spec (ensure committed).
* GitHub Action: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` step _Validate API contract with Schemathesis_.

## 7. Blockers / concerns

* **Legacy paths still in schema**: front-end renames not mirrored in URLConf – causes 404 noise.
* **Schemathesis misclassifying auth**: may require schema tweaks or CLI flags.
* Timeouts / log truncation make diagnosing CI runs harder; consider uploading `schemathesis-output.txt` artifact.
