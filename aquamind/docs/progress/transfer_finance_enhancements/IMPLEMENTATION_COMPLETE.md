## 💰 Finance Transaction Flows

### Flow 1: Freshwater → Farming (Post-Smolt Transfer)

```
Transfer Scenario:
├── Source: 10 Post-Smolt tanks (Norway Freshwater)
├── Destination: 12 Adult sea rings (Norway Farming)
├── Biomass: 1,250 kg
├── Pricing: 168 NOK/kg (lifecycle-based)
└── Value: 210,000 NOK

Workflow:
Day 1-14: Ship crew executes 10 transfer actions
Day 14: Last action completed → Workflow COMPLETED
System: Auto-creates IntercompanyTransaction
  ├── content_type: BatchTransferWorkflow
  ├── object_id: workflow.id
  ├── amount: 1,250 kg × 168 NOK = 210,000 NOK
  ├── currency: NOK
  └── state: PENDING

Day 14 (later): Farming Manager approves
  └── State: PENDING → POSTED

Next Week: Finance exports to NAV
  └── State: POSTED → EXPORTED
```

### Flow 2: Farming → Harvest (Adult Harvest)

```
Harvest Scenario:
├── Source: Adult fish in sea rings (Norway Farming)
├── Destination: Processing facility (Norway Harvest)
├── Weight: 5,000 kg
├── Grade: Superior
├── Pricing: Market-based
└── Value: Calculated from market rates

Existing Flow (unchanged):
├── HarvestEvent created
├── Finance projection runs
├── IntercompanyTransaction created (grade-based pricing)
└── Same approval/export workflow
```

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Innovation #1: Polymorphic Finance Transactions

**Problem**: Needed to support both harvest AND transfer sources  
**Solution**: GenericForeignKey with ContentType  
**Benefit**: Single transaction model for all intercompany flows

### Innovation #2: Dual Pricing Models

**Problem**: Transfers use lifecycle pricing, harvests use grade pricing  
**Solution**: `pricing_basis` field with conditional validation  
**Benefit**: Flexible pricing strategies per business process

### Innovation #3: Graceful Error Handling

**Problem**: Missing pricing policy shouldn't break transfer completion  
**Solution**: Try-except with logging, workflow still completes  
**Benefit**: Operations continue, finance can create manually

### Innovation #4: Mobile-First Action Execution

**Problem**: Ship crew executes transfers during voyages  
**Solution**: Touch-optimized dialog with large inputs  
**Benefit**: Fast execution from phones/tablets at sea
