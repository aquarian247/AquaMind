# Server-side Aggregation for KPI Cards — Implementation Plan (Issue-ready)

Audience: **Backend engineers**  
Purpose: Split the recommendations into outcome-driven, single-session tasks with standardized guidance to minimize context rot. Each task below is presented as an **issue** (title + body, issues 44 through 53 in github). This must all be done in the same feature branch: features/aggregations-for-frontend

---

## Shared context to read before any task

* Recommendations: `aquamind/docs/progress/aggregation/server-side-aggregation-kpi-recommendations.md`
* API standards: `aquamind/docs/quality_assurance/api_standards.md`
* Existing aggregates to mirror
  * `apps/infrastructure/api/viewsets/overview.py`
  * `apps/batch/api/viewsets.py` → `BatchContainerAssignmentViewSet.summary`
  * `apps/inventory/api/viewsets/feeding.py` → `FeedingEventViewSet.summary`

## Git Workflow Best Practices

### 🎯 One Feature Branch, One Comprehensive PR

**For cohesive features with multiple tightly-coupled issues:**
- ✅ **Use one feature branch** for all related issues (e.g., `features/aggregations-for-frontend`)
- ✅ **Complete all issues** before creating PR
- ✅ **Create one comprehensive PR** at the end covering the entire feature
- ✅ **Commit frequently** with clear messages referencing issue numbers

**Benefits:**
- **No merge conflicts** between related changes
- **Complete feature testing** before review
- **Cleaner git history** with feature-focused commits
- **Better reviewer experience** seeing the full feature
- **Easier rollback** if issues arise

**When to use this approach:**
- Multiple issues that are tightly coupled
- Shared dependencies between issues
- Need to test complete feature integration
- Want to deliver as one cohesive unit for UAT

**Example commit messages:**
```
feat: implement area KPI summary endpoint (#45)
feat: implement station KPI summary endpoint (#46)
feat: implement hall KPI summary endpoint (#47)
# ... more implementation commits ...
docs: update aggregation playbook with additional patterns
test: add comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
```

**Avoid:** Multiple PRs per issue for tightly-coupled features (creates unnecessary complexity and potential conflicts).

## Session Playbook (use for every task)

1. Pre-read shared context (5–10 min) **and** the task's References list.
2. Add endpoint/action skeleton with explicit kebab-case basename and `extend_schema`. Keep under `/api/v1/`.
3. Implement DB-level aggregates (`Sum` / `Count`), add 30–60 s cache via `cache_page`.
4. Add tests (success, edge cases, filters, caching neutrality) and update OpenAPI schema.
5. Run Django tests **and** OpenAPI validation; ensure no drf-spectacular warnings.

**Definition of Done (applies to all tasks)**
✔ Endpoint functional with documented schema and inputs.
✔ Tests cover happy-path + edge cases + filter variations.
✔ OpenAPI validates; CI passing locally.
✔ Caching set to 30–60 s where applicable.
✔ Naming/routers follow `api_standards.md`.

## Issue 1 (no. 44 in github) — Establish Aggregation Implementation Playbook (patterns, tests, docs)

**Title:** Establish Aggregation Implementation Playbook (patterns, tests, docs)

**Body**

**Summary**
Make sure we are on a main and everything is pruned and remnant feature branches are deleted. Then create features/aggregations-for-frontend branch for this side-quest.
Create a small shared "playbook" to standardize how we build aggregation endpoints for KPI cards (patterns, caching, schema, tests). This reduces context rot across sessions.

**Outcome**
A concise doc and example snippet(s) that every subsequent task follows. CI validation steps are codified.

**Scope**
* Add a short doc section (or sibling doc) with:
  * Required imports, `@action` vs APIView selection, example `extend_schema`, `cache_page`.
  * Test example structure using `reverse()` with kebab-case basenames.
  * OpenAPI validation command and expectations.
* **No business endpoint implementation here.**

**References**
See shared context list.

**Approach**
Add "Session Playbook" section (if not already) + minimal code & test template.

**Acceptance Criteria**
* Playbook published; linked from recommendations doc.
* Includes code templates, test template, and validation commands.

**✅ COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive aggregation playbook at `docs/development/aggregation_playbook.md` with patterns, imports, caching, schema, tests, and OpenAPI validation. Linked from recommendations doc. Established Git workflow best practices in implementation plan.

## Issue 2 (no. 45 in github) — Area KPI Summary endpoint (/infrastructure/areas/{id}/summary/)

**Title:** Implement Area KPI Summary endpoint (containers, biomass, population, avg weight)

**Body**

**Summary**
Add a detail action that returns area-level KPI metrics for KPI cards, replacing client-side joins in `useAreaKpi`.

**Outcome**
GET returns: `container_count`, `ring_count`, `active_biomass_kg`, `population_count`, `avg_weight_kg`.

**Scope**
* `@action(detail=True, methods=['get'])` on `AreaViewSet`.
* Compute via ORM aggregates across Containers in area and active BatchContainerAssignments.
* 30–60 s cache; `extend_schema`.

**References**
Frontend hook, recommendations doc, overview & assignment summaries.

**Implementation Steps**
1. Add action `summary(self, request, pk=None)`.
2. Query containers; calc counts/sums; derive avg weight.
3. Schema + caching + tests.

**Testing**
`apps/infrastructure/tests/api/test_area_summary.py` with multiple scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**
Endpoint metrics correct; tests pass; OpenAPI validates.
