# Or run Session 2 specifically
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --session=2
```

### Validate Session 1 Results
```bash
# Check database contents
py manage.py shell -c "
from apps.batch.models import Batch
from apps.environmental.models import EnvironmentalReading
from apps.infrastructure.models import Container, Sensor
print(f'Batches: {Batch.objects.count()}')
print(f'Environmental Readings: {EnvironmentalReading.objects.count()}')
print(f'Containers: {Container.objects.count()}')
print(f'Sensors: {Sensor.objects.count()}')
"
```
