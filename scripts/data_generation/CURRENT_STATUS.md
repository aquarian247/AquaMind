# AquaMind Data Generation - Current Status

**Date:** 2024-12-17  
**Session:** Implementation Session 1  
**Status:** ✅ Orchestrator Ready | 🚧 Generators In Progress

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Implementation Plan & Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with checkable phases
- ✅ Documented 4-session architecture (Years 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10)
- ✅ Progress tracking integrated with markdown updates

### 2. Orchestrator Framework
- ✅ **Checkpoint Manager** (`orchestrator/checkpoint_manager.py`)
  - State persistence and recovery
  - Session-specific checkpoints
  - Resume capability from failure points
  
- ✅ **Memory Manager** (`orchestrator/memory_manager.py`)
  - Real-time memory monitoring (currently using 57.5 MB)
  - Automatic cleanup when approaching limits
  - Emergency cleanup procedures
  - Memory usage reporting
  
- ✅ **Progress Tracker** (`orchestrator/progress_tracker.py`)
  - Session timing and metrics
  - Automatic plan updates
  - Report generation
  
- ✅ **Session Manager** (`orchestrator/session_manager.py`)
  - Multi-session coordination
  - Dependency checking
  - Dry-run capability

### 3. Configuration System
- ✅ **Generation Parameters** (`config/generation_params.py`)
  - All constants from tech spec
  - 45 target active batches
  - TGC growth models
  - Feed management parameters
  - Environmental ranges
  
- ✅ **Disease Profiles** (`config/disease_profiles.py`)
  - 10 disease types modeled
  - Seasonal patterns
  - Treatment protocols
  - Co-infection probabilities

### 4. Entry Points & Testing
- ✅ **Main Runner** (`run_generation.py`)
  - Command-line interface
  - Session selection
  - Resume capability
  - Validation mode
  
- ✅ **Test Suite** (`test_orchestrator.py`)
  - All components tested
  - Dry-run verification

## 🚧 Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Generators
1. **Infrastructure Generator** - Set up geography, areas, stations, containers
2. **Initial Batch Generator** - Create first 15-20 batches with staggered starts
3. **Environmental Baseline Generator** - Generate 3 years of environmental data

### Phase 2: Core Simulation
1. **Batch Lifecycle Simulator** - Handle transitions, transfers, growth
2. **Mortality Calculator** - Base rates + disease impacts
3. **Feed Management System** - FIFO inventory, procurement, consumption

### Phase 3: Integration
1. **Daily Operation Simulator** - Main loop processing all active batches
2. **Disease Outbreak Scheduler** - Realistic disease events
3. **Treatment System** - Vaccination and treatment protocols

## 📊 Memory & Performance Considerations

### Current Memory Profile
- Orchestrator overhead: ~57 MB
- Estimated per-session peaks:
  - Session 1: 8 GB (infrastructure setup)
  - Session 2: 12 GB (disease modeling)
  - Session 3: 12 GB (steady operations)
  - Session 4: 6 GB (validation)

### Optimization Strategies
- ✅ Chunked data generation (30-day chunks)
- ✅ Periodic memory cleanup
- ✅ Bulk database inserts (5000 record batches)
- ✅ Checkpoint/resume capability

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Separation of Concerns
- **Core Simulation**: Actual batch data, real events, historical records
- **NOT Included**: Scenario planning projections (as requested)

### Realistic Business Modeling
- 40-50 active batches maintained
- Staggered production cycles
- Grace periods for biosecurity
- Seasonal batch start patterns

### Data Integrity
- All operations through Django models
- Business logic preserved
- Audit trails maintained
- Validation at each step

## 🚀 How to Run

### Test the System
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/test_orchestrator.py
```

### Start Generation (when ready)
```bash
# Run all sessions
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py

# Run specific session
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --session=1

# Resume from checkpoint
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --resume

# Dry run (no data)
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --dry-run
```

## 📦 Git Status

**Branch:** `feature/10-year-data-generation`  
**Status:** ✅ Committed and pushed to remote  
**Commit:** `6967eac` - feat: Implement 10-year data generation orchestration framework  
**Ready for:** Next session to implement actual data generators  

### To continue work:
```bash
git checkout feature/10-year-data-generation
```

### To merge when complete:
Create a pull request from `feature/10-year-data-generation` to `main`

## 📝 Notes

- All work contained within `scripts/` folder as requested
- No interference with parallel development
- Checkpoint files stored in `scripts/data_generation/checkpoints/`
- Logs saved to `scripts/data_generation/logs/`
- Reports generated in `scripts/data_generation/reports/`

## 🔍 Current Focus

Working on Session 1 generators:
- Infrastructure setup
- Initial batch creation
- Environmental baseline

The orchestrator is fully functional and tested. Now implementing the actual data generation logic that will plug into this framework.
