# AquaMind Test Data Generation Scripts

## üö® **ARCHITECTURAL RESET - STARTING FRESH**

**Previous data generation system had fundamental architectural flaws** where environmental data was completely disconnected from batch lifecycles (0% of 62.9M readings linked to assignments).

**Starting clean with BCA-centric design** focused on temporal traceability for salmon CV generation.

## üéØ **Core Principle: BCA-Centric Architecture**

**Everything revolves around `BatchContainerAssignment` (BCA)** - the central object that tracks which fish are where and when:

```python
# BCA is the heart of salmon CV generation
class BatchContainerAssignment(models.Model):
    batch = models.ForeignKey(Batch)
    container = models.ForeignKey(Container)
    lifecycle_stage = models.ForeignKey(LifecycleStage)
    assignment_date = models.DateField()      # When fish arrived
    departure_date = models.DateField(null=True)  # When they left
    population_count = models.IntegerField()  # How many fish
    biomass_kg = models.DecimalField()        # Total weight
```

**All data generation must link to active BCAs** to create traceable salmon CVs.

## üèóÔ∏è **New BCA-Centric Architecture**

### **Core Principle: Assignment-Driven Generation**
```python
def generate_for_date(date):
    """Generate data only for active batch-container assignments"""

    active_assignments = BatchContainerAssignment.objects.filter(
        assignment_date__lte=date,
        departure_date__gte=date  # or departure_date__isnull=True
    )

    for assignment in active_assignments:
        # Generate ALL data for this specific assignment
        generate_environmental_data(assignment, date)
        generate_feeding_events(assignment, date)
        generate_health_monitoring(assignment, date)
        generate_growth_samples(assignment, date)
        # ... all other data types
```

### **Salmon CV Traceability**
Every piece of data must enable reconstruction of individual fish lifecycles:
- **Temporal Precision**: All timestamps must align with BCA periods
- **Assignment Linking**: Every record links to the specific BCA where fish existed
- **Lifecycle Continuity**: Data flows seamlessly as fish move between containers

## üìä **PRODUCTION SCALE OVERVIEW**

### **Annual Production Targets**
- **Faroe Islands:** 60,000 tonnes filleted salmon/year
- **Scotland:** 40,000 tonnes filleted salmon/year
- **Average Salmon Weight:** 6kg at harvest
- **Total Annual Production:** ~16.7 million salmon
- **Batch Size:** ~3.5 million eggs (initial)
- **Survival Rate:** ~80% at harvest (~900 days)
- **Total Lifecycle:** 900 days (2.5 years)

### **Infrastructure Scale**
- **Freshwater Stations:** 15 (Faroe) + 10 (Scotland) = 30 total
- **Sea Areas:** 30 (Faroe) + 30 (Scotland) = 60 total
- **Rings per Area:** 20 rings √ó 60 areas = 1,200 sea rings
- **Containers per Freshwater Hall:** 12 containers
- **Halls per Station:** 5 halls (Egg/Alevin, Fry, Parr, Smolt, Post-Smolt)
- **Total Freshwater Containers:** 30 stations √ó 5 halls √ó 12 containers = 1,800

### **Daily Data Generation Scale**
- **Active BCAs:** 2,500-3,500 simultaneously active
- **Environmental Readings:** 10,000+ per day (4-8 per BCA)
- **Feeding Events:** 4,000+ per day (4 per feeding BCA)
- **Health Records:** ~125 per day (every 20 days per BCA)
- **Mortality Events:** Daily per BCA

assert EnvironmentalReading.objects.filter(batch_container_assignment__isnull=True).count() == 0

# All readings must be within BCA date ranges
for reading in EnvironmentalReading.objects.all():
    bca = reading.batch_container_assignment
    assert bca.assignment_date <= reading.reading_time.date()
    assert reading.reading_time.date() <= (bca.departure_date or date.today())
