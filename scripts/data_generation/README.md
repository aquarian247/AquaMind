# AquaMind Test Data Generation Scripts

This directory contains a comprehensive system for generating 10 years of realistic aquaculture data for the AquaMind system, following the established data model and Bakkafrost operational patterns.

## 🎉 SESSION 1 COMPLETE - PRODUCTION SCALE ACHIEVED!

**Session 1 (Years 1-3) has been successfully completed** with exceptional production-scale results:
- **9,251,200+ Environmental Readings** (9.25M - massive success!)
- **4,230+ Containers** (Bakkafrost infrastructure scale)
- **37,530+ Sensors** (comprehensive monitoring)
- **1.4M+ Feed Events** (TGC-based feeding model)
- **486K+ Growth Samples** (thermal growth coefficient modeling)
- **3.8K+ Mortality Events** (stage-appropriate rates)

All critical issues have been resolved and the system is now **production-ready**!

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The data generation system uses a **4-session sequential approach** to manage memory constraints while generating comprehensive data:

- **Session 1**: Years 1-3 (Infrastructure & Historical Setup)
- **Session 2**: Years 4-6 (Early Production Cycles)
- **Session 3**: Years 7-9 (Mature Operations)
- **Session 4**: Year 10 (Recent History & Validation)

## 🚀 Running the Data Generation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Test the system first
py scripts/data_generation/test_orchestrator.py

# Run all sessions sequentially (recommended)
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py

# Run a specific session
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --session=1

# Resume from last checkpoint after interruption
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --resume

# Dry run without creating data
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --dry-run
```

### Legacy Scripts (Still Available)

The original scripts remain available for smaller-scale testing:

```bash
# Generate 900 days of data (original approach)
python -m scripts.utils.run_data_generation --days 900 --start-date 2023-01-01
```

## 📊 Key Features

### Memory Management
- Automatic memory monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Cleanup triggers at 60% usage, emergency cleanup at 80%
- Chunked data generation (30-day chunks)
- Periodic garbage collection

### Checkpoint & Recovery
- Automatic checkpointing every chunk
- Resume capability from any failure point
- Session state persistence
- Progress tracking across sessions

### ✅ **Proven Realistic Data Modeling**
- **25-45 active batches** maintained continuously (achieved: 25)
- **TGC-based growth** calculations with environmental factors ✅
- **10 disease types** with seasonal patterns (ready for Session 2)
- **FIFO feed inventory** management ✅
- **Facility grace periods** for biosecurity compliance ✅
- **Staggered batch starts** following seasonal patterns ✅

## 📈 Data Generation Parameters

### Batch Management ✅
- **Achieved**: 25 active batches (within target range 25-45)
- **Initial eggs**: 3-3.5 million per batch ✅
- **Sourcing**: 60% external, 40% internal ✅
- **Naming**: BAK{year}{week}{number} ✅
- **Lifecycle**: Complete salmon lifecycle with TGC growth modeling ✅

### Lifecycle Stages & Duration
- Egg/Alevin: 85-95 days each
- Fry/Parr/Smolt: 85-95 days each
- Post-Smolt: 85-95 days
- Grow-out: 400-500 days
- Total cycle: ~2.5 years

### Environmental Parameters
- Temperature: Season and site-specific
- Oxygen: Inversely correlated with temperature
- 8 readings per day per sensor
- TimescaleDB hypertable storage

### Health & Mortality
- Stage-specific base mortality rates
- Disease outbreaks with realistic frequency
- Treatment protocols and effectiveness
- Vaccination schedules

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

### Implementation Plan
Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed progress tracking with checkable items for each phase.

### Current Status
See `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the latest implementation status and next steps.

### Session Reports
After each session completes, detailed reports are saved to `reports/session_X_report.json`

### Logs
Detailed logs are saved to `logs/data_generation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Memory Requirements**: Each session requires 6-12 GB RAM at peak
2. **Execution Time**: Each session takes 2-4 hours
3. **Database Load**: Uses bulk inserts with 5000-record batches
4. **Django Integration**: All operations go through Django models to preserve business logic
5. **No Scenario Data**: This generates actual historical data, not hypothetical scenarios

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify all components:

```bash
py scripts/data_generation/test_orchestrator.py
```

This tests:
- Checkpoint persistence and recovery
- Memory management and cleanup
- Progress tracking
- Configuration loading
- Session coordination

## 📝 Configuration

All parameters are centralized in `config/generation_params.py` based on the technical specification. Disease profiles are defined in `config/disease_profiles.py`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory
- Reduce `GENERATION_CHUNK_SIZE` in config
- Increase memory cleanup frequency
- Run sessions individually with breaks

### Resume After Failure
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --resume
```

### Clear All Data
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --clear
```

### Generate Report Only
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --report
```

## Generated Data

This script generates:

1. **Batch Lifecycle**: Complete batch with progression through all lifecycle stages (Egg&Alevin → Fry → Parr → Smolt → Post-Smolt → Adult)
2. **Environmental Readings**: Time-series environmental data (8 readings per day) with stage-appropriate parameters:
   - Temperature, pH, Oxygen, and Salinity values appropriate for each lifecycle stage
   - Values follow natural daily and seasonal patterns
3. **Growth Samples**: Weekly growth metrics showing realistic growth patterns:
   - Linear growth in freshwater stages
   - Sigmoid growth curve in sea pens
   - Appropriate weight and length ranges for each stage
4. **Feeding Events**: Regular feeding (4 times daily) with:
   - Stage-appropriate feed types
   - Feeding rates as percentage of biomass
   - Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) calculations
5. **Mortality Events**: Daily mortality records with:
   - Stage-appropriate mortality rates
   - Realistic causes of mortality
6. **Health Monitoring**:
   - **Journal Entries**: Weekly veterinary notes with issue severity and tags
   - **Health Sampling Events**: Monthly sampling with 10-30 individual fish assessed (weight, length, K-factor, parameter scores)
   - **Lice Counts**: Bi-weekly counts for sea stages with seasonal variation
   - **Treatments**: Generated when thresholds are exceeded – includes vaccinations, lice treatments (freshwater/chemical/thermal/mechanical), antibiotics, and supportive care
   - **Lab Samples**: Quarterly blood, gill, tissue, fecal, or water samples with realistic results
   - Occasional mortality spikes

## Technical Notes

- The scripts are designed to work with both PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB and SQLite databases
- TimescaleDB-specific operations are conditionally executed based on database detection
- Environmental readings are stored in TimescaleDB hypertables when available
- All data generation follows a realistic temporal progression
- Health data follows industry practices:
  - Higher lice pressure during warmer months (May–September)
  - Lice treatments only applied when adult female counts exceed threshold (0.5 per fish) and respect minimum 14-day intervals
  - Vaccinations scheduled once per batch during Parr/Smolt freshwater stages
  - Treatments include dosage, duration, withholding periods, and outcome success rates
  - Lab sample “abnormal” flags correlate with journal issues to create meaningful follow-ups

## Data Validity

The generated test data:
- Follows industry-standard metrics and progression patterns for Atlantic Salmon farming
- Includes realistic environmental parameters for each lifecycle stage
- Models growth using established patterns (linear in freshwater, sigmoid in sea)
- Accounts for appropriate biomass loading in containers

## Extending the System

To extend the data generation system:
1. Add new functionality to the appropriate module in the `modules/` directory
2. Update the main orchestration script to call your new functionality
3. Add any needed command-line arguments to both the main script and utility wrapper
