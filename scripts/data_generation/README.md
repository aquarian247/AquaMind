## 🚀 Running the Data Generation (M4 Max Optimized)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Test the system first
py scripts/data_generation/test_orchestrator.py

# Run all sessions sequentially (recommended)
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py

# Run a specific session (1-4 available)
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --session=1

# Resume from last checkpoint after interruption
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --resume

# Dry run without creating data
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --dry-run
```

### **Actual Performance (M4 Max)**
- **Session 1 (Years 1-3)**: ~3 hours (initial run, pre-optimization)
- **Session 2 (Years 4-6)**: ~2 hours (partial optimization)
- **Session 3 (Years 7-9)**: ✅ **1.5 hours** (fully optimized)
- **Session 4 (Year 10)**: ~30-45 minutes (estimated)
- **Total Runtime**: ~6.5-7 hours for complete 10-year dataset
- **Memory Usage**: Up to 100GB but efficiently managed
- **Data Volume**: Same comprehensive 10-year dataset

### Legacy Scripts (Still Available)

The original scripts remain available for smaller-scale testing:

```bash
# Generate 900 days of data (original approach)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **System Requirements (Optimized for M4 Max)**
1. **Memory Requirements**: Each session uses up to 100 GB RAM (128GB system optimized)
2. **Execution Time**: Each session takes ~1-2 hours (vs 2-4 hours on 32GB systems)
3. **Database Load**: Uses bulk inserts with 15,000-record batches for optimal performance
4. **Django Integration**: All operations go through Django models to preserve business logic
5. **No Scenario Data**: This generates actual historical data, not hypothetical scenarios

### **Performance Improvements**
- **~50% faster execution** due to larger chunks and optimized batch sizes
- **Reduced checkpoint overhead** with fewer session transitions
- **Better memory utilization** with higher thresholds for 128GB systems
- **Improved database performance** with larger batch operations

```

This tests:
- Checkpoint persistence and recovery
- Memory management and cleanup
- Progress tracking
- Configuration loading
- Session coordination

## 📝 Configuration

All parameters are centralized in `config/generation_params.py` based on the technical specification. Disease profiles are defined in `config/disease_profiles.py`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Environmental Readings Issues (Common Pain Point)

Environmental readings generation was a major pain point in Sessions 1 & 2. Here are the solutions:

#### **Issue 1: No Environmental Readings Generated**
**Symptoms:** Environmental readings count not increasing despite script running
**Root Cause:** Model field access errors in environmental complexity generator
**Solution:**
- Check `EnvironmentalReading` model uses `value` field + `parameter.name` for access
- Don't use direct attributes like `reading.temperature` - use `reading.parameter.name == 'Temperature'`
- Ensure `select_related('parameter')` for efficient parameter name access

#### **Issue 2: TURBIDITY Sensors Not Removed**
**Symptoms:** TURBIDITY sensors still present after requesting removal
**Root Cause:** TURBIDITY sensors may be created by infrastructure generator
**Solution:**
```python
# Delete TURBIDITY sensors and readings
from apps.environmental.models import Sensor, EnvironmentalReading, EnvironmentalParameter
turbidity_param = EnvironmentalParameter.objects.get(name='TURBIDITY')
Sensor.objects.filter(parameter=turbidity_param).delete()
EnvironmentalReading.objects.filter(parameter=turbidity_param).delete()
```

#### **Issue 3: SALINITY in Wrong Locations**
**Symptoms:** SALINITY readings in freshwater containers or missing from sea areas
**Root Cause:** Sensor placement logic needs container location verification
**Solution:**
- Check `container.area` vs `container.hall` for location determination
- Sea areas should have SALINITY sensors, freshwater halls should not
- Use container geography to determine appropriate parameters

#### **Issue 4: Model Field Access Errors**
**Symptoms:** `'EnvironmentalReading' object has no attribute 'temperature'`
**Root Cause:** Attempting to access parameter values as direct model attributes
**Solution:**
```python
# WRONG - Don't do this:
reading.temperature = 15.0

# CORRECT - Do this:
if reading.parameter.name == 'Temperature':
    reading.value = 15.0
```

#### **Issue 5: Foreign Key Constraint Errors**
**Symptoms:** `null value in column "feed_container_id"` or similar
**Root Cause:** Missing related objects (FeedContainer, LifecycleStage, etc.)
**Solution:**
- Ensure all required related objects exist before creating dependent records
- Create missing `FeedContainer` objects for areas with active containers
- Verify `LifeCycleStage` objects exist with proper `species` relationships

### Out of Memory
- Reduce `GENERATION_CHUNK_SIZE` in config
- Increase memory cleanup frequency
- Run sessions individually with breaks

### Resume After Failure
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --resume
```

### Clear All Data
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --clear
```

### Generate Report Only
```bash
py scripts/data_generation/run_generation.py --report
```

## Generated Data

This script generates:

1. **Batch Lifecycle**: Complete batch with progression through all lifecycle stages (Egg&Alevin → Fry → Parr → Smolt → Post-Smolt → Adult)
2. **Environmental Readings**: Time-series environmental data (8 readings per day) with stage-appropriate parameters:
   - Temperature, pH, Oxygen, and Salinity values appropriate for each lifecycle stage
   - Values follow natural daily and seasonal patterns
3. **Growth Samples**: Weekly growth metrics showing realistic growth patterns:
   - Linear growth in freshwater stages
   - Sigmoid growth curve in sea pens
   - Appropriate weight and length ranges for each stage
4. **Feeding Events**: Regular feeding (4 times daily) with:
   - Stage-appropriate feed types
   - Feeding rates as percentage of biomass
   - Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) calculations
5. **Mortality Events**: Daily mortality records with:
   - Stage-appropriate mortality rates
   - Realistic causes of mortality
6. **Health Monitoring**:
   - **Journal Entries**: Weekly veterinary notes with issue severity and tags
   - **Health Sampling Events**: Monthly sampling with 10-30 individual fish assessed (weight, length, K-factor, parameter scores)
   - **Lice Counts**: Bi-weekly counts for sea stages with seasonal variation
   - **Treatments**: Generated when thresholds are exceeded – includes vaccinations, lice treatments (freshwater/chemical/thermal/mechanical), antibiotics, and supportive care
   - **Lab Samples**: Quarterly blood, gill, tissue, fecal, or water samples with realistic results
   - Occasional mortality spikes

## Technical Notes

- The scripts are designed to work with both PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB and SQLite databases
- TimescaleDB-specific operations are conditionally executed based on database detection
- Environmental readings are stored in TimescaleDB hypertables when available
- All data generation follows a realistic temporal progression
- Health data follows industry practices:
  - Higher lice pressure during warmer months (May–September)
  - Lice treatments only applied when adult female counts exceed threshold (0.5 per fish) and respect minimum 14-day intervals
  - Vaccinations scheduled once per batch during Parr/Smolt freshwater stages
  - Treatments include dosage, duration, withholding periods, and outcome success rates
  - Lab sample “abnormal” flags correlate with journal issues to create meaningful follow-ups

## Data Validity

The generated test data:
- Follows industry-standard metrics and progression patterns for Atlantic Salmon farming
- Includes realistic environmental parameters for each lifecycle stage
- Models growth using established patterns (linear in freshwater, sigmoid in sea)
- Accounts for appropriate biomass loading in containers

## Extending the System

To extend the data generation system:
1. Add new functionality to the appropriate module in the `modules/` directory
2. Update the main orchestration script to call your new functionality
3. Add any needed command-line arguments to both the main script and utility wrapper
