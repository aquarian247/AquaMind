**Database successfully wiped and reset!**

### What Was Preserved
- ✅ **6 Users** - Authentication and user profiles intact
- ✅ **Database Schema** - All table structures maintained
- ✅ **Django Migrations** - Migration history preserved
- ✅ **TimescaleDB Configuration** - Hypertables and compression settings intact

### What Was Cleared
- ❌ **All Application Data** - Infrastructure, batches, environmental readings, health records, inventory, etc.
- ❌ **Checkpoint Files** - All session checkpoints removed
- ❌ **Report Files** - All generation reports cleared
- ❌ **Historical Data** - Audit trails cleared

## 🎯 Current State

### Database Status
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Review Technical Specifications**
Before starting data generation, carefully review:
- `scripts/data_generation/AquaMind Data Generation Technical Specification.md`
- `aquamind/docs/database/data_model.md`
- `scripts/data_generation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### 2. **Plan Data Integrity from Start**
- Implement direct FK relationships from day one
- Focus on proper assignment linking for "salmon CV" use case
- Use TimescaleDB effectively for environmental readings

### 3. **Start Fresh Generation**
```bash
# Begin with Session 1 infrastructure
python scripts/data_generation/orchestrator/session_manager.py run_session session_1

# Then Session 2, 3, 4 in order
python scripts/data_generation/orchestrator/session_manager.py run_session session_2
python scripts/data_generation/orchestrator/session_manager.py run_session session_3
python scripts/data_generation/orchestrator/session_manager.py run_session session_4
```

### 4. **Key Improvements to Implement**
- ✅ **Direct Assignment FKs** - Link environmental readings directly to BatchContainerAssignment
- ✅ **Proper Lifecycle Stages** - Post-smolt in freshwater, adult phase 450+ days
- ✅ **Accurate Growth Curves** - Use TGC model with correct stage durations
- ✅ **Data Integrity Validation** - Verify relationships at each step
- ✅ **TimescaleDB Optimization** - Proper partitioning and compression

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Backup First**: Always backup before major operations
2. **Test Incrementally**: Generate small amounts first, verify data integrity
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch memory usage and TimescaleDB performance
4. **Validate Relationships**: Ensure salmon CV requirements are met
5. **Document Changes**: Update technical specs as you implement improvements

## 🛠️ Available Tools

- **Database Wipe Script**: `scripts/database_wipe.py` (reusable)
- **Data Generation**: `scripts/data_generation/orchestrator/session_manager.py`
- **Data Verification**: Create integrity verification scripts
- **Technical Specs**: Available in `scripts/data_generation/` and `docs/`

## 🎉 Ready for Fresh Start!

The database is now clean and ready for a fresh, well-planned data generation process. Take your time with the technical specifications and implement data integrity from the ground up.

**Happy data generating! 🐟✨**
