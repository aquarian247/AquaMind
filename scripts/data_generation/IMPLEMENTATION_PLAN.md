- Designed 4-session architecture
- Started Phase 0: Foundation Setup

### 2025-08-19
- Completed Phase 0: Foundation Setup (orchestrator, checkpoint system, memory management)
- Implemented all Session 1 data generators:
  - `generators/infrastructure.py` - Complete infrastructure generation
  - `generators/batch.py` - Batch lifecycle management with staggered starts
  - `generators/environmental.py` - Environmental data with correlations
  - `generators/operations.py` - Daily operations (feeding, mortality, vaccinations)

- Successfully tested with dry run and test suite
- Created permanent database clearing utility (`clear_data.py`)

### 2025-08-20
- Session 1 Implementation Progress (PARTIAL - IN PROGRESS):
  - Fixed Django model field mismatches (FeedingEvent, Container, Species, etc.)
  - Implemented realistic production parameters based on Bakkafrost model (100k tons/year)
  - Fixed batch scheduling to match production cycles (25 active batches for 2.5-year cycle)
  - Fixed feed type creation to match lifecycle stages
  - Issues Identified:
    * Missing sea cage infrastructure (no Sea Cage Small/Large containers created)
    * Container capacity bottlenecks (insufficient Pre-Transfer Tanks)
    * Environmental readings not being created (needs investigation)
  - Achieved ~40% completion (420 days of 1095 days)
