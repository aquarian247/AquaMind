# AquaMind Frontend · OpenAPI Integration Success Report  
_Date: 2025-07-22_

---

## 1. What Was Accomplished
- Synchronized the latest `api/openapi.yaml` from the backend (`feature/api-contract-unification` branch).
- Regenerated the TypeScript API client via `npm run generate:api` (openapi-typescript-codegen).
- Fixed compilation issues: `npm run type-check` completed with **0 errors**.
- Verified production build: `npm run build` finished successfully with no warnings other than size hints.
- Committed regenerated client (`client/src/api/generated/`) to Git (`ab61a44`).
- Restored and validated `vite.config.ts`, enabling the dev server to boot.

## 2. Current Server Status
| Service    | Command Used                                | Port | Status |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|------|--------|
| Backend    | `venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver` | 8000 | ✅ Running |
| Frontend   | `npm run dev` (Express + Vite, Django mode)   | 5001 | ✅ Running |

Proxy configuration: `/api/*` → `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 3. Verification of Working Integration
1. Frontend dev server logs report **“API Mode: Django”** and successful proxy creation.  
2. Curling `http://localhost:5001/api/v1/batch/batches/` returns `401 Authentication credentials were not provided.`— confirms:
   • Request reached backend  
   • DRF auth guard active.
3. React application loads without console errors and network requests are proxied to port 8000.
4. No TypeScript or runtime errors observed during navigation of primary routes (`/dashboard`, `/batch-management`, `/inventory`).

## 4. Next Steps for Manual QA
1. **Login Flow**
   - Use known test user or create via Django admin.
   - Confirm JWT stored and passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
2. **Core Workflows**
   - Batch list, create, edit, transfer.
   - Feed purchase + FIFO stock display.
   - Environmental monitoring charts (precision should show **4 dp**).
3. **Decimal Formatting Audit**
   - Mass / currency fields: **2 dp** (e.g., `45.67 kg`, `$12.34`).
   - Sensor & scientific values: **4 dp** (e.g., `7.1234 ppm`).
4. **Error Handling**
   - Force 400 & 404 responses and ensure toasts show proper messages.
5. **Cross-Browser Smoke**
   - Quick check in Chrome / Edge to rule out CORS or HMR glitches.
